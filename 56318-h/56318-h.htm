<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>Much has been written concerning Wellington and his
famous Peninsular Army in the way of formal history:
this volume, however, will I think contain somewhat that
is new to most students concerning its organization, its
day by day life, and its psychology. To understand the
exploits of Wellington’s men, it does not suffice to read a
mere chronicle of their marches and battles. I have
endeavoured to collect in these pages notices of those
aspects of their life with which no strategical or tactical
work can deal, though tactics and even strategy will not
be found unnoticed.</p>

<p>My special thanks are due to my friend Mr. C. T.
Atkinson, Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, for allowing
me to use the admirable list of the brigade and divisional
organization of the Peninsular Army which forms Appendix
II. It is largely expanded from the article on the same
topic which he printed eight years ago in the <cite>Historical
Review</cite>, and enables the reader to find out the precise
composition of every one of Wellington’s units at any
moment between April, 1808 and April, 1814. I have
also to express my gratitude to the Hon. John Fortescue,
the author of the great <cite>History of the British Army</cite>, for
answering a good many queries which I should have found
hard to solve without his aid. The index is by the same
loving hand which has worked on so many of my earlier
volumes.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I" class="nobreak vspace">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="subhead">INTRODUCTORY—THE OLD PENINSULAR ARMY</span></h2>

<p>While working for the last nine years at the History of
the Peninsular War, I have (as was inevitable) been compelled
to accumulate many notes, and much miscellaneous
information which does not bear upon the actual chronicle
of events in the various campaigns that lie between 1808
and 1814, but yet possesses high interest in itself, and
throws many a side-light on the general course of the war.
Roughly speaking, these notes relate either to the personal
characteristics of that famous old army of Wellington,
which, as he himself said, “could go anywhere and do anything,”
or to its inner mechanism—the details of its management.
I purpose to speak in these pages of the leaders
and the led; of the daily life, manners, and customs of
the Peninsular Army, as much as of its composition and its
organization. I shall be dealing with the rank and file
no less than with the officers, and must even find space for a
few pages on that curious and polyglot horde of camp
followers which trailed at the heels of the army, and frequently
raised problems which worried not only colonels
and adjutants, but even the Great Duke himself.</p>

<p>There is an immense amount of interesting material
to be collected, concerning the inner life of the Peninsular
Army, from public documents, such as despatches, general
orders, and regimental reports, and records of courts martial.
But I shall be utilizing to a much greater extent non-official<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
information, collected from the countless diaries, memoirs,
and series of contemporary letters, which have come
down to us from the men who took part in the great war.
Nor are the controversial pamphlets to be neglected, which
kept appearing for many a year, when one survivor of the
old army found, in the writings of another, statements
which he considered injurious to himself, his friends, his
regiment, or his division. The best known and most
copious of these discussions is that which centres round the
publication of Napier’s <cite>Peninsular War</cite>; the successive
appearance of its volumes led to the printing of many
protests, in which some of the most prominent officers of
Wellington’s army took part—not only Lord Beresford,
who was Napier’s especial butt and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bête noir</i>, and replied
to the historian in terms sometimes not too dignified—but
Cole, Hardinge, D’Urban, and many more. This set of
“strictures”, as they were called, mainly relate to the
Albuera campaign. But there are smaller, but not less
interesting, series of controversial pamphlets relating to
the Convention of Cintra, to Moore’s retreat, to the campaign
of 1810 (Bussaco), the storm of Badajoz, and other
topics.</p>

<p>The memoirs and autobiographies, of course, possess
the greatest share of interest. And it may be noted as a
remarkable fact that those coming from the rank and file
are not very much less numerous than those which come
from the commissioned ranks. If there are scores of
diaries and reminiscences of colonels, captains, and subalterns,
there are at least dozens of little books by sergeants,
corporals, and privates. Many of these are very quaint
productions indeed, printed at local presses—at Perth,
Coventry, Cirencester, Louth, Ashford—even at Corfu.
Very frequently some knot of military or civilian friends
induced a much-travelled veteran to commit to paper the
tales which had been the delight of the canteen, or of the
fireside of some village inn. They are generally very
good reading, but often give rather the spirit of the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
and the regiment than an accurate record of its long-past
exploits. One or two of these veterans’ artless tales show
all the characteristics of the memoirs of the prince of their
tribe—the delightful but autolatrous Marbot. I have
thought it worth while to give in an appendix the names and
titles of the best of them. One or two, above all the little
book of “Rifleman Harris” of the 95th, well deserve to be
republished, but still await that honour. Perhaps regimental
patriotism may some day provide us with a series
of reprints of the best Soldiers’ Tales.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Memoirs of the Rank and File</div>

<p>It is a very notable fact, which requires (but has never
hitherto received) an explanation, that it is precisely with
the coming in of the nineteenth century that British
soldiers and officers alike began to write diaries and reminiscences
on a large scale, and in great numbers. I do
not, of course, mean to say that there were none such produced
in the eighteenth century. Besides serious military
histories like those of Kane, Stedman, or Tarleton, there
do exist a certain number of narratives of personal adventure
written by officers, such as Major Rogers the Scout, or
the garrulous and often amusing diarist (unfortunately
anonymous) who made the campaign of Culloden with the
Duke of Cumberland—not to speak of the semi-apochryphal
Captain Carleton. But they are few, and the writings from
the ranks are fewer still, though there are certain soldiers’
letters which go back as far as Marlborough’s time, and
one or two small books like Bristow’s and Scurry’s Indian
reminiscences, and Sergeant Lamb’s <cite>Journal</cite> in the American
War of Independence, which are worth mentioning. But
it is quite certain that there was more writing going on in
the army during the ten years 1805–1815 than in the whole
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>What was the explanation of the phenomenon? There
are, I think, two main causes to be borne in mind: the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
first was the glorious and inspiring character of Wellington’s
campaigns, which made both officers and men justifiably
proud of themselves, and more anxious than any previous
generation had been to put on paper the tale of their own
exploits. It must have been a man of particularly cheerful
disposition who cared to compile the personal narrative of
his adventures during the Old American War, which was
largely a record of disaster, or even in the ups and downs
of the Seven Years’ War, when for every Minden or Quebec
there had been an evil memory like Ticonderoga or Kloster-Kampen.
It is to this instinctive dislike to open up old
memories of misfortune that we may attribute the fact that
the first British campaigns of the French Revolutionary
War, the unhappy marches and battles of the Duke of
York’s army in 1793, 1794, 1795 are recorded in singularly
few books of reminiscences—there are only (to my knowledge)
the doggerel verse of the “Officer of the Guards,”
with its valuable foot-notes, and the simple memoirs of
Sergeant Stevenson of the Scots Fusilier Guards, and
Corporal Brown of the Coldstream. This is an extraordinarily
small output for a long series of campaigns, in
which some 30,000 British troops were in the field, and
where gallant exploits like those of Famars and Villers-en-Cauchies
took place. But the general tale was not one
on which any participant could look back with pleasure.
Hence, no doubt, the want of books of reminiscences.</p>

<p>But I fancy that there is another and a quite distinct
cause for the extraordinary outburst of interesting military
literature with which the nineteenth century begins, and we
may note that this outburst certainly commences a little
before the Peninsular War. There exist several very good
personal narratives both of the Conquest of Egypt in 1801,
of the Indian Wars during the Viceroyalty of Lord Wellesley,
and of the short campaign of Maida. And this cause
I take to be the fact that the generation which grew up
under the stress of the long Revolutionary War with France
was far more serious and intelligent than that which saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
it begin, and realized the supreme importance of the ends
for which Great Britain was contending, and the danger
which threatened her national existence. The empire had
been in danger before, both in the Seven Years’ War, and
in the War of American Independence, but the enemy had
never been so terrifying and abhorrent as the Jacobins
of the Red Republic. The France of Robespierre was
loathed and feared as the France of Louis XV. or Louis XVI.
had never been. To the greater part of the British nation
the war against the Revolution soon became a kind of
Crusade against the “triple-headed monster of Republicanism,
Atheism, and Sedition.” The feeling that Great
Britain had to fight not so much for empire as for national
existence, and for all that made life worth having—religion,
morality, constitution, laws, liberty—made men desperately
keen for the fight, as their ancestors had never
been.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sword and the Pen</div>

<p>Among the many aspects which their keenness took, one
was most certainly the desire to record their own personal
part in the great strife. It is in some such way only that I
can explain the fact that the actually contemporary diaries
and journals become so good as the war wears on, compared
to anything that had gone before. Memoirs and reminiscences
written later do not count in the argument, because
they were compiled and printed long after the French war
was over, and its greatness was understood. But the abundance
of good material written down (and often sent to the
press) during the continuance of the war is astounding.
In some cases we can be sure that we owe the record to the
reason that I have just suggested. For example, we certainly
owe to it the long and interesting military diaries of Lord
Lynedoch (the Sir Thomas Graham of Barrosa), who most
decidedly went into the Revolutionary War as a Crusader
and nothing less. As I shall explain when dealing with his
remarkable career, he started military life at forty-four,
mortgaging his estates to raise a battalion, and suddenly
from a Whig M.P. of the normal type developed into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
persistent and conscientious fighter against France and
French ideas—whether they were expressed (as when first
he drew the sword) in the frenzied antics of the Jacobins,
or (as during his latter years) in the grinding despotism
of Bonaparte. His diary from first to last is the record of
one who feels that he is discharging the elementary duty
of a good citizen, by doing his best to beat the French
wherever they may be found.</p>

<p>I take it that the same idea was at the bottom of the
heart of many a man of lesser note, who kept his pen busy
during those twenty eventful years. Some frankly say that
they went into the service, contrary to the original scheme
of their life, because they saw the danger to the state,
and were ready to take their part in meeting it. “The
threat of invasion fired every loyal pair of shoulders for a
red coat.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>Of the men whose memoirs and letters I have read,
some would have been lawyers (like Sir Hussey Vivian),
others politicians, others doctors, others civil servants,
others merchants, if the Great War had not broken out.
I should imagine that the proportion of officers who had
taken their commission for other reasons than that they
had an old family connection with the army, or loved
adventure, was infinitely higher during this period than it
had ever been before. A very appreciable number of them
were men with a strong religious turn—a thing I imagine
to have been most unusual in the army of the eighteenth
century (though we must not forget Colonel Gardiner).
One young diarist heads the journal of his first campaign
with a long prayer.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Another starts for the front with a
final letter to his relatives to the effect that “while striving
to discharge his military duties he will never forget his
religious ones: he who observes the former and disregards
the latter is no better than a civilized brute.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Men of Religion</div>

<p>There were Peninsular officers who led prayer-meetings
and founded religious societies—not entirely to the delight
of the Duke of Wellington,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> whose own very dry and
official view of religion was as intolerant of “enthusiasm”
as that of any Whig bishop of Mid-Georgian times. Some
of the most interesting diaries of the war are those of men
who like Gleig, Dallas, and Boothby, took Holy Orders
when the strife came to an end. One or two of the authors
from the ranks show the same tendencies. Quartermaster
Surtees was undergoing the agonies of a very painful conversion,
during the campaign of 1812, and found that the
memories of his spiritual experiences had blunted and
dulled his recollection of his regimental fortunes during
that time.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> A very curious book by an Irish sergeant of
the 43rd devotes many more pages to religious reflections
than to marches and bivouacs.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> Another writer of the same
type describes himself on his title-page as “Twenty-one
years in the British Foot Guards, sixteen years a non-commissioned
officer, forty years a Wesleyan class leader,
once wounded, and two years a Prisoner.”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>On the whole I am inclined to attribute the great improvement
alike in the quantity and the quality of the information
which we possess as to the inner life of the army,
during the second half of the great struggle with France,
not only to the fact that the danger to the empire and the
great interests at stake had fired the imagination of many
a participant, but still more to the other fact that the body
of officers contained a much larger proportion of thoughtful
and serious men than it had ever done before. And the
same was the case <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i> with the rank and file<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
also. Not but what—of course—some of the most interesting
information is supplied to us by cheerful and garrulous
rattlepates of a very different type, who had been
attracted into the service by the adventure of the soldier’s
life, and record mainly its picturesque or its humorous
side.</p>

<span class="subhead">SOURCES OF INFORMATION—THE LITERATURE OF THE
PENINSULAR WAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It will be well, perhaps, to give a short account of the main
sources from which our knowledge of the Peninsular Army
is derived. The official ones must be cited first. The most
important of all are, naturally enough, the Wellington
Dispatches. Of these there are two series; the first, in twelve
volumes, was published during the Duke’s lifetime by
Colonel Gurwood between 1837 and 1839. The second, or
supplementary series, in fifteen volumes, was published
with copious notes by the second Duke of Wellington
between 1858 and 1872.</p>

<p>The series edited by Gurwood is absolutely necessary
to every student of the Peninsular War, but is most tiresome
to handle, and is by no means complete. The Duke
forbade the publication of a great number of his more confidential
letters, and ordered portions of others to be omitted.
He had a strong notion that a great deal of historical information
could be, and ought to be, suppressed; this fact
has caused much trouble to the modern historian, who
wishes to obtain not a mere official and expurgated view of
the war, but a full and complete survey of it. To show
Wellington’s attitude it may be sufficient to quote his
answer to William Napier, who asked for leave to utilize
all his papers. “He could not tell the whole truth without
hurting the feelings of many worthy men, and without
doing mischief. Expatiating on the subject, he related
many anecdotes illustrating this observation, showing errors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
committed by generals and others—especially at Waterloo—errors
so materially affecting his operations that he could
not do justice to himself if he suppressed them, and yet
by giving them publicity he would ungraciously affect
the favour of many worthy men, whose only fault was
dullness.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Gurwood and the Duke’s Dispatches</div>

<p>The Gurwood edition of the dispatches was published
some fifteen years after Napier made his application, but
numbers of the old Peninsular officers were still alive, and
the Duke adhered to his already-expressed opinion that it
would not be well to expose old quarrels and old blunders.
Paragraphs, accordingly, are often omitted in the reprint,
and in a large majority of cases, where blame was imputed
or reproofs administered to any individual, the name was
left blank. This makes the edition most tiresome to read.
It is exasperating to find that <i>e.g.</i> “nothing has given me
more concern in the late operations than the conduct of
Lieut.-Colonel —— of the —— Regt.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> or that “no means
exists of punishing military disorders and irregularities of
the kind committed by Brigadier-General —— and Colonel ——.”
Or again, when Wellington writes to the Patronage
Secretary at the Horse Guards that “I am much obliged to
you for relieving me from Major-General —— and Colonel ——.
I have seen General —— and I think he will do
very well, and so will ——”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>; or that “—— appears to be a
kind of madman,” and “—— is not very wise,” the reader
is reduced to despair. The only way of discovering the
names, which are often those of officers of high rank, who
figure repeatedly in any narrative of the Peninsular War,
is to go to the original dispatches at the Record Office, or,
when the communication is a private and not a public one,
to the letters at Apsley House. Meanwhile, few have the
leisure or the patience to do this, so that Wellington’s
judgments on his lieutenants are still practically inaccessible.</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, still necessary to leave all these blanks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
in 1837. And Gurwood was no doubt acting in strict
obedience to the Duke’s orders. But nothing can excuse
his own slack editing of the massive tomes that he published.
There are no tables of contents to the volumes, nor does
the title page of each indicate the dates between which it
runs. To find out which volume will contain a letter of
November, 1810, we must take down Vols. VI. and VII.,
and see from the date of the last dispatch in one and the
first in the other, when the break comes. Supposing we
wish to discover how many communications were sent to
Graham or Spencer in 1811, there is no other way of achieving
our object than running through every page of the two
volumes in which the correspondence of that year is contained!
There is a so-called index to the whole series,
but it is practically useless, from the small number of
headings given. The reader will look in it vainly for obvious
places-names such as Chaves, Casal Novo, Castello Branco,
Vera, St. Pierre, for personal names such as Lapisse, Latour-Maubourg,
Bonnet, Montbrun, Abadia, Penne-Villemur,
O’Donnell, Del Parque, Erskine, Anson, Victor Alten,
Barnard, Beckwith. On the other hand he will find silly
headings such as under L, “Lies, encouragement of,” or
under I, “Invincibility of British Troops.” Perhaps the
most ridiculous entry in this absurd compilation is that of
“Light Division,” to which there is annexed just one
note, “satisfactory conduct of, on April 6, 1811,” as if that
was the sole occasion on which it was necessary to mention
that distinguished unit of the British army. There are no
headings under regiments at all, so that if one wishes to
see what the Duke said about the 52nd or the Black Watch,
one simply gets no help.</p>

<p>But there is another trick of Gurwood’s which is even
worse than his want of tables of contents or adequate
index-entries. He omitted all the elaborate statistics
which used to accompany the Duke’s dispatches, without
exception. The beautiful tables of casualties which
explain the distribution of losses between regiments and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
divisions, are in every case boiled down into three bald
totals of “killed, wounded, and missing,” for the whole
army, no indication of units being left. Even Lord Londonderry’s
modest two volumes, the first attempt at a general
history of the Peninsular War, give far more useful information
on the all-important topics of strengths and
losses than all Gurwood’s tomes. For that sensible author
rightly saw that nothing could be more serviceable to the
reader than an occasional table of the organization and
numbers of the whole allied army, and that the detailed
casualty-list of such a fight as Talavera or Albuera is
indispensable. The purblind Gurwood preferred to put in
a note, “the detail of divisions, regiments, and battalions
has been omitted, being too voluminous,”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> when he was
dealing with an important return. The historian owes
him small thanks for his precious opinion.</p>

<p>It is an immense relief to pass from Gurwood’s ill-arranged
work to the volumes of the <cite>Wellington Supplementary
Dispatches</cite>, which were published by the second
Duke between 1858 and 1872. Though the mass of
Peninsular material contained in this series is comparatively
small, it comprises a great quantity of familiar and private
correspondence, which had been deliberately omitted from
the earlier publication. And, moreover, it is admirably
edited; the second Duke knew what was important and
what required explanation, appended valuable and
copious notes, and was able (since the elder generation was
now practically extinct) to abandon the exasperating
reticence used by Gurwood. Moreover, he added a vast
quantity of letters written not by, but to, his father, which
serve to explain the old Duke’s sometime cryptic replies
to his correspondents. Even a few necessary French
documents have been added. Altogether these volumes
are excellent, and make one wish that the editing of the
whole of the Wellington papers had fallen into the same
hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington’s “General Orders”</div>

<p>There is a third series of Official publications which
though not so “generally necessary for salvation” as the
Dispatches, for any student of the Peninsular War, is very
valuable and needs continually to be worked up. This is
the seven volumes of <cite>General Orders</cite>, from 1809 to 1815,
which are strictly contemporary documents, as they were
collected and issued while the war was in progress—the
1809–10 volumes were printed in 1811, the 1811 volume
in 1812, and so on. The last, or Waterloo volume, had the
distinction of being issued by the British Military Press in
Paris, “by Sergeant Buchan, 3rd Guards,” as printer.
The <cite>General Orders</cite> contain not only all the documents
strictly so called, the notices issued by the commander-in-chief
for the army, but an invaluable <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">précis</i> of all courts-martial
other than regimental ones, and a record of promotions,
gazettings of officers to regiments, rules as to issue
of pay and rations, and directions as to all matters of detail
relating to organization, hospitals, depôts, stores, routes,
etc. If any one wishes to know on what day the 42nd was
moved from the first to the second division, when precisely
General Craufurd got leave to go home on private business,
what was the accepted value of the Spanish dollar or the
Portuguese Cruzado Novo at different dates, when expressed
in English money, or what was the bounty given when a
time-expired man consented to renew his service for a
limited period, these are the volumes in which he will find
his curiosity satisfied. They cannot be called interesting
reading—but they contain facts not elsewhere to be
found.</p>

<p>There is an exactly corresponding series of General
Orders for the Portuguese Army, in six yearly volumes,
called <cite xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Ordens do Dia</cite>: it was issued by Marshal Beresford,
and contains all the documents signed by him. Whenever
a student is interested in the career of one of the numerous
British officers in the Portuguese service, he must seek
out the records of his doings in these volumes. They are
not easy to work in, as they have no yearly indices, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
much patience is required to discover isolated notices of
individuals. These volumes are practically inaccessible in
England. It was with the greatest difficulty that a Lisbon
friend hunted me up a copy after long search, and I am not
aware that there is another on this side of the sea. But by
its use only can we trace the service of any Anglo-Portuguese
officer. There was supposed to be an “Ordem”
every morning, and when nothing was forthcoming in the
way of promotions, court-martial reports, or decrees, Beresford’s
chief of the staff used to publish a solemn statement

<p>This happened on an average about twice a week.</p>

<p>In addition to these printed series there is an immense
amount of unprinted official correspondence in the Record
Office which bears on the Peninsular War. It will be found
not only in the War Office section, but in those belonging
to the Foreign Office and the Admiralty. As an example
of the mysteries of official classification, I may mention
that all documents relating to French prisoners will have
to be looked for among the Admiralty records, under the
sub-headings <i>Transport</i> and <i>Medical</i>. If, as occasionally
happens, one wishes to find out the names and regiments
of French officers captured on some particular occasion,
<i>e.g.</i> Soult’s retreat from Oporto, or the storm of Badajoz,
it is to the Admiralty records that one must go! Officers
can always be identified, but it is a herculean task to deal
with the rank and file, for they used to be shot into one of
the great prisons, Norman’s Cross, Porchester, Stapleton,
etc., in arbitrary batches, with no regard to their regimental
numbers. It would take a week to hunt through the
prison records with the object of identifying the number
of privates of the 34th Léger captured at Rodrigo, since
they may have gone in small parties to any one of a dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
destinations. Many of the prison registers have lost one
or other of their outer-boards, and the handling of them
is a grimy business for the fingers, since they are practically
never consulted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Record Office and its Wealth</div>

<p>While nearly the whole of the Wellington dispatches
have been printed, it is only a small part of the Duke’s “enclosures”,
added to each dispatch, that have had the same
good fortune. These always repay a cursory inspection,
and are often highly important. The greater part of Sir
John Moore’s correspondence with Lord Castlereagh, and
many dispatches of Moore’s subordinates—Baird, Leith, and
Lord W. Bentinck—with a number of valuable returns
and statistics,—are printed in a large volume entitled “<cite>Papers
Relative to Spain and Portugal, Presented to Parliament
in 1809</cite>.” There are, to the best of my knowledge, no
similar volumes relating to Graham’s campaign from Cadiz
in 1811, or Maitland’s and Murray’s operations on the east
side of Spain in 1813–14. A good deal of information
about the latter, however, may be got from the enormous
report of the court-martial on Murray, for his wretched
<em>fiasco</em> at the siege of Tarragona, which is full of valuable
facts. The details of the other minor British enterprises
in the Peninsula—such as those of Doyle, Skerret, Sir
Home Popham, and Lord Blayney, all remain in manuscript,—readily
accessible to the searcher, but not too often consulted.
The Foreign Office section at the Record Office
is highly valuable not only to the historian of diplomacy,
but to the purely military historian, because Stuart,
Vaughan, Henry Wellesley, and the other representatives
of the British Government at Madrid, Seville, and Cadiz,
used to send home, along with their own dispatches, numberless
Spanish documents. These include not only official
papers from the Regency, but private documents of great
value, letters from generals and statesmen who wish to
keep the British agent informed as to their views, when they
have clashed with the resolves of their own government.
There are quite a number of military narratives by Spanish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
officers, who are set on excusing themselves from responsibility
for the disasters of their colleagues. And the
politicians sometimes propose, in private and confidential
minutes, very curious plans and intrigues. Sir Charles
Vaughan kept a certain number of these confidential papers
in his own possession when he left Cadiz, and did not turn
them over to the Foreign Office. They lie, along with
his private correspondence, in the Library of All Souls’
College, Oxford.</p>

<p>Since we are dealing with the British army, not with
the general history of the Peninsular War, I need only
mention that unpublished documents by the thousand,
relating to the French, Spanish, and Portuguese armies,
may be found at Paris, Madrid, and Lisbon, and that the
researcher is invariably welcomed and courteously treated.
It may be worth while to make a note, for the benefit of
beginners, to the effect that the French military documents
are not concentrated in one mass, but are divided between
the <cite>Archives Nationales</cite>, and the <cite>Archives de la Guerre</cite> at
the Ministry of War. If a return or a dispatch is not to
be found in one of these repositories, it may yet turn up
in the other. The Spanish records are very “patchy,”
full on some campaigns, almost non-existent on others.
For example, the documents on the luckless Ocaña campaign
of 1809 are marvellously few; there does not exist
a single complete “morning state”, by regiments and
divisions, of Areizaga’s unhappy army. I fancy that the
whole of the official papers of his staff were captured in the
rout, and destroyed by ignorant plunderers—they did not
get into the French collections. Hence there have only
survived the few dispatches which Areizaga and some of
his subordinates sent to the Spanish Ministry of War.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contemporary Journals</div>

<p>So much for Official Records. Passing on to the publications
of individual actors in the war, we must draw a
sharp line between those which were issued during or immediately
after the campaigns with which they deal, and those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
which were written down, with or without the aid of contemporary
notes or journals, many years after. The former,
of course, possess a peculiar interest, because the writers’
narrative is not coloured by any knowledge of what is yet
to come. An officer writing of Corunna or Talavera with
the memory of Vittoria and Waterloo upon him, necessarily
took up a different view of the war from the man who set
down his early campaign without any idea of what was to
follow. Early checks and hardships loom larger in the
hour of doubt and disappointment, than when the recollection
of them has been dimmed by subsequent hours of
triumph. The early material, therefore, is very valuable,
but it is not so copious as that which was written down
later, and it largely exists in the form of letters and diaries,
both of which are less readable than formal narratives.
As good types of this sort of material we may name Ormsby’s
and Ker-Porter’s <cite>Journals of the Campaign of 1808–09</cite>,
Hawkers’ <cite>Journal of the Talavera Campaign</cite>, Stothert’s
<cite>Diary of 1809–11</cite>, and General MacKinnon’s Journal of
the same three years, all of which were published within a
few months of the last entry which each contains. Next
to these come the books which consist of contemporary
material, published without alteration from the original
manuscripts, but only many years after they had been
written. The best of these for hard facts, often facts not
to be found elsewhere, is the diary of Tomkinson of the
16th Light Dragoons:<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> with it may be mentioned the
Journal of George Simmons of the 95th, published in 1899
with the title, “A British Rifle Man,”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> the Journals of Sir
William Gomm, 1808–15,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Sir George Warre’s Letters
of 1808–12,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> which only saw the light two years ago, and
Larpent’s <cite>Private Journal</cite>, printed in 1852.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> These volumes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
all have short notes by the editors, but the text is the writing
of the Peninsular time, untampered with and unaltered.</p>

<p>These books and their minor contemporaries stand in
a class by themselves, as contemporary material reflecting
accurately the spirit of the times. Much more numerous,
however, are the books which, though produced by actors
in the Great War, appeared at dates more or less remote
from the years whose events they narrate. The formal
histories are comparatively few, the reason being that
Napier’s magnificent (if somewhat prejudiced and biassed)
volumes completely put off other possible authors, who
felt that they lacked his genius and his power of expression,
from the idea of writing a long narrative of the war as a
whole. This was a misfortune, since the one book which
all students of military history are thereby driven to read,
was composed by a bitter political partisan, who is set on
maligning the Tory government, has an altogether exaggerated
admiration for Napoleon, and owned many
personal enemies in the British army, who receive scant
justice at his hands. At the same time we must be grateful
that the work was written by one who was an actual
witness of many of the campaigns that he relates, conscientiously
strove to get at all other first-hand witnesses,
and ransacked the French as well as the British official
papers, so far as he could obtain access to them. The merits
of his style are all his own, and will cause the <cite>History of
the Peninsular War</cite> to be read as an English classic, as
Clarendon’s <cite>History of the Great Rebellion</cite> is read, even
when research has shown (as in Clarendon’s case) that
much of the narrative needs reconstruction, and that the
general thesis on which it is constructed lacks impartiality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Napier, Southey, and Lord Londonderry</div>

<p>The only other general histories of the war which
appeared were Southey’s (three vols. published 1832) and
Lord Londonderry’s.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> The former was written by a literary
man without any military experience, who had seen nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
of the Peninsula during the years of the struggle, and had
as almost his only merit, a good knowledge of the Spanish
sources, of which he was too uncritical. The book fell
dead, being unable to compete with Napier, and lacking all
the authority of personal knowledge which was the latter’s
strong point. The smaller book of Lord Londonderry
(two volumes, published 1829) is by no means without merit,
but has many faults, always hovering on the edge between
formal history and personal reminiscences. Wherever
Charles Stewart had not been present, he passes lightly over
the episodes of war, and obviously had taken no very great
pains to collect first-hand material. At the same time the
book has value, as giving the views of a highly-placed staff
officer, who had the opportunity of seeing every episode
from the point of view of Head Quarters, and had strong
convictions and theories of his own. He had also the saving
grace of loving statistics, and printed many valuable
appendices of “morning states” and casualty-lists, things
of which Napier was far too sparing, and which Gurwood
suppressed altogether. As a general record the book could
not cope with Napier, and has been forgotten—somewhat
undeservedly—no less than Southey’s vast quartos. There
is absolutely no other general history by a contemporary
which needs mention. Of course I omit foreign sources,
which help us little with regard to the British army, though
they are indispensable for a general study of the war. Foy’s
unfinished <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Guerre de la Peninsule</cite>, if we may judge from the
volumes which appeared before his death, would have been
a very prejudiced affair—his account of the British troops
in Vol. I. is a bitter satire, contrasting oddly enough with
his confessions concerning their merits in his <cite>Journal</cite>, of
which a large portion was published a few years ago by
Girod de l’Ain under the title <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vie Militaire du Général Foy</cite>.
After all the detraction in his formal history, it is interesting
to read the frank letter which says, in 1811, that for a set
battle on a limited front he acknowledges the superiority
of the English infantry to the French, “I keep this opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
to myself,” he adds, “and have never divulged it, for it
is necessary that the soldier in the ranks should not only
hate his enemy, but also despise him.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Foy kept the
opinion so closely to himself, that no one would have
suspected it who had read only his formal history of the
Peninsular War.</p>

<p>Another French general history is Marshal Jourdan’s
<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Guerre d’Espagne</cite>, issued only ten years ago by the Vicomte
de Grouchy, though large parts of it had been utilized in
Ducasse’s <cite>Life and Correspondence of King Joseph Bonaparte</cite>.
This covers the whole war down to Vittoria, and
is notable for its acute and often unanswerable criticism of
Soult and Masséna, Marmont, and, not least, of Napoleon
himself. It is less satisfactory as a vindication of Jourdan’s
own doings. Marmont’s autobiography only covers his fifteen
months of command from May, 1811, to July, 1812: while
St. Cyr’s and Suchet’s very interesting accounts of their
own periods of activity relate entirely to Catalonia and the
eastern side of the Peninsula. St. Cyr does not touch
British affairs at all; Suchet treats his campaigns against
Maitland and Murray in a much more cursory style than
his previous successes against the Spanish armies.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> The
other French formal narratives by contemporaries and
eye-witnesses are for the most part monographs on particular
campaigns in which the writers took part—such as Thiébault’s
work on Junot in Portugal—full of deliberate
inaccuracies—which was published in 1817, and Lapène’s
<cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Conquête d’Andalousie, en 1810–12</cite>, and <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Campagnes de
1813–14</cite> (both published in 1823 in volumes of different
size) which deal only with the army of Soult. There are,
however, two general histories by German officers—Schepeler
(who served with the Spaniards), and Riegel (who served
with the French)—which both require mention. The former
is especially valuable.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Toreno, Belmas, John Jones</div>

<p>Among Peninsular historians two deserve special notice.
The Conde de Toreno, a Spanish statesman who had taken
part in the war as a young man, produced in 1838 three
massive volumes which are, next to Napier, the greatest
book that makes this war its subject. He is a first-hand
authority of great merit, and should always be consulted
for the Spanish version of events. He was a great master
of detail, and yet could paint with a broad brush. It is
sometimes necessary to remember that he is a partisan,
and has his favourites and his enemies (especially La
Romana) among the generals and statesmen of Spain.
But on the whole he is a historian of high merit and
judgment. With Toreno’s work must be mentioned the
five small volumes of the Portuguese José Accursio das
Neves, published in 1811, when Masséna had but just
retreated from before the Lines of Torres Vedras. This is
a very full and interesting description of Junot’s invasion
of Portugal, and of the sufferings of that realm which
came to an end with the Convention of Cintra. It is
the only detailed picture of Portugal in 1808. Unfortunately
the author did not complete the story of 1809–10.</p>

<p>At the end of this note on historical works, as distinguished
from memoirs or diaries of adventure, we must
name two excellent books, one English and one French,
on the special subject of siege operations. These two
monographs by specialists, both distinguished engineer
officers—Sir John Jones’ <cite>Journal of the Sieges in Spain
1811–13</cite>, and Colonel Belmas’ <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Journaux des Sièges dans
la Peninsule 1808–13</cite>, published respectively in 1827 and
1837—are among the most valuable books dealing with the
Peninsular War, both containing a wealth of detail and
explanatory notes. The work of Belmas is especially rich
in reprints of original documents bearing on the sieges, and
in statistics of garrisons, losses, ammunition expended, etc.
They were so complete, and supplemented each other so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
well, that little was done to add to the information that they
give, till Major J. Leslie’s admirable edition of the <cite>Dickson
Papers</cite> began to appear a few years ago, and appreciably
increased our knowledge of the English side of the siege
operations.</p>

<p>Having made an end of the formal histories written
by contemporaries and eye-witnesses, it remains that we
should speak of a class of literature much larger in bulk,
and generally much more interesting, considered in the light
of reading for the general student—the books of autobiographies
and personal reminiscences which were written
by participants in the war some time after it had come to
an end—at any time from ten to forty years after 1814.
Their name is legion. I am continually discovering more
of them, many of them printed obscurely in small editions
and from local presses, so that the very knowledge of
their existence has perished. And so many unpublished
manuscripts of the sort exist, in France no less than in
England, that it is clear that we have not even yet got to
the end of the stock of original material bearing on the war.
Some of the most interesting, <i>e.g.</i> the lively autobiography
of Blakeney of the 28th,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> and that of Ney’s aide-de-camp
Sprünglin,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> have only appeared during the last few years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inaccuracies of Memoir-writers</div>

<p>These volumes of personal adventures differ greatly
in value: some were written up conscientiously from contemporary
diaries: others contain only fragments, the most
striking or the most typical incidents of campaigns whose
less interesting every-day work had been forgotten, or at
least had grown dim. Unfortunately in old age the memory
often finds it hard to distinguish between things seen and
things heard. It is not uncommon to find a writer who
represents himself as having been present at scenes where
he cannot have been assisting, and still more frequent to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
detect him applying to one date perfectly genuine anecdotes
which belong to another. One or two of the most readable
narratives frankly mix up the sequence of events, with a
note that the exact dating can not be reconstructed. This
is notoriously the case with the most vivid of all the books
of reminiscences from the ranks—the little volume of
“Rifleman Harris,” whose tales about General Robert
Craufurd and the Light Division flow on in a string, in which
chronology has to take its chance, and often fails to find it.</p>

<p>Another source of blurred or falsified reminiscences is
that an author, writing many years after the events which
he has to record, has generally read printed books about
them, and mixes up this secondary knowledge with the
first-hand tale of his adventures. Napier’s Peninsular War
came out so comparatively early, and was so universally
read, that screeds from it have crept into a very great
number of the books written after 1830. Indeed, some
simple veterans betray the source of their tales, concerning
events which they cannot possibly have witnessed themselves,
by repeating phrases or epigrams of Napier’s which
are unmistakeable. Some even fill up a blank patch in
their own memory by a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">précis</i> of a page or a chapter from
the great history. It is always necessary to take care
that we are not accepting as a corroboration of some tale,
that which is really only a repetition of it. The diary of
a sergeant of the 43rd mentioned above,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> contains an
intolerable amount of boiled-down Napier. It is far more
curious to find traces of him in the famous Marbot, who
had clearly read Mathieu Dumas’ translation when it came
out in French.</p>

<p>The books of personal adventure, as we may call the
whole class, may roughly be divided into three sections,
of decreasing value in the way of authority. The first and
most important consists of works written upon the base of
an old diary or journal, where the memory is kept straight
as to the sequence of events by the contemporary record,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
and the author is amplifying and writing up real first-hand
material. Favourable examples of this are Leach’s <cite>Rough
Sketches of the Life of an Old Soldier</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> Leslie of Balquhain’s
<cite>Military Journal</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> which in spite of its title is not in journal
shape, but reads as a continuous narrative, and Sir George
Bell’s <cite>Rough Notes of Fifty Years’ Service</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> all of which are
definitely stated by the authors to have been founded on
their note-books of the war time, and therefore can as a
rule be treated as first-hand evidence. They can generally
be trusted as authorities against any divergent tales based
on the narratives of writers who wrote their reminiscences
without any such foundation, and where they get off the
lines of contemporary evidence they usually give the reader
warning. For example, Leach gives valuable material to
show the inaccuracy of Napier’s exaggerated estimate of
the length and pace of the Light Division’s march to
Talavera, whose erroneous figures have been repeated in so
many subsequent books. And yet Leach was not conscious
of the fact that the data which he gives were incompatible
with Napier’s story, and repeats it in a general way—because
he published his book several years after the
appearance of Napier’s second volume, and had (like many
other members of the Light Division) absorbed the legend
as a matter of faith on Napier’s authority. It was reserved
for Sir John Bell,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> who had served under Craufurd but
joined too late for Talavera, to explode the story. But his
demonstration of its inaccuracy has not travelled far,
while the original legend has gone all round the world,
and is still reproduced, as an example of unparalleled rapidity
of movement, in serious military works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gleig, Blakeney, Hennegan</div>

<p>Infinitely less valuable than the books founded on
private diaries or letters of contemporary date, are those
which were written down long after the war, from unaided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
memory only. They are, of course, progressively less
valuable for evidence according as the date at which they
were indited recedes from the period with which they deal.
Gleig’s charming <cite>The Subaltern</cite>, printed as early as 1825,
may be better trusted for matters of detail than Blakeney’s
equally vivid narrative written in the remote island of
Paxos about 1835, and Blakeney is more valuable than
Hennegan’s highly romantic <cite>Seven Years of Campaigning</cite>,
published only in 1847, when thirty winters had blurred
reminiscence, and allowed of the accretion of much second-hand
and doubtful material round the original story. The
strength of men’s memories differs, so does their appreciation
of the relative value of a dramatic narrative as compared
with a photographic record of personal experiences. But
in a general way we must allow that every year that elapses
between the event and the setting down of its narrative
on paper decreases progressively the value of the record.
As an example of the way in which the failing powers of
old age can confuse even a powerful memory, we may mention
the curious fact that Wellington himself, twenty years
after his last campaign, seems to have told two auditors
that he had visited Blücher’s camp on the very eve of
Waterloo, the night between the 17th and 18th of June,
1815, a statement quite incredible.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> It was apparently
a blurred memory of his real visit to the Prussian headquarters
on the early afternoon of the 16th, of which ample
details are known.</p>

<p>Failing memory, the love of a well-rounded tale, a spice
of autolatry, and an appreciation of the picturesque, have
impaired the value of many a veteran’s reminiscences.
Especially if he is a well-known <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">raconteur</i>, and has repeated
his narrative many times before he sets it down on paper,
does it tend to assume a romantic form. The classical
example, of course, is Marbot, whose memoirs contain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
many things demonstrably false, <i>e.g.</i> that he brought the
news of the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Dos Mayo</i> insurrection at Madrid to Napoleon,
or that in 1812 he took his regiment from Moscow to the
neighbourhood of Poltava, and brought it back (400 miles!)
in less than a fortnight with a convoy of provisions, or that
he saw 6000 men drowned on the broken ice of the lake of
Satschan at the end of the battle of Austerlitz.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Marbot
is, of course, an extreme example of amusing egotism, but
parallels on a minor scale could be quoted from many of
his contemporaries, who wrote their tale too late. We
may mention Thiébault’s account of the combat of Aldea
da Ponte, when he declares that he fought 17,000 Anglo-Portuguese
and produced 500 casualties in their ranks,
when he was really opposed by one British brigade and two
Portuguese battalions, who lost precisely 100 men between
them. Yet the account is so lengthy and detailed, that if
we had not the British sources before us, we should be
inclined to think that we were reading an accurate narrative
of a real fight, instead of a romantic invention reconstructed
from a blurred memory. It was the only Peninsular
fight in which Thiébault exercised an independent
command—and every year added to its beauties as the
general grew old.</p>

<p>While, therefore, we read the later-written Peninsular
narratives with interest, and often with profit, as reflections
of the spirit of the time and the army, we must always be
cautious in accepting their evidence. And we must begin
by trying to obtain a judgment on the “personal equation”—was
the author a hard-headed observer, or a lover of
romantic anecdotes? What proportion, if any, of the facts
which he gives can be proved incompatible with contemporary
records? Or again, what proportion (though not demonstrably
false) seem unlikely, in face of other authorities?
Had he been reading other men’s books on a large scale?
Of this the usual proof is elaborate narrative concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
events at which he cannot possibly have been present,
with or without citation of the source from which he has
obtained the information. It is only when the author has
passed his examination with credit on these points, that we
can begin to treat him as a serious authority, and to trust
him as evidence for scenes at which we know that he was
actually present. Many a writer of personal adventures
may finally be given his certificate as good authority for
the annals of his own battalion, but for nothing more.
It is even possible that we may have to make the further
restriction that he may be trusted on the lucky days, but not
on the less happy ones, in the history of his own beloved
corps. Reticence as to “untoward incidents” is not uncommon.
As to things outside the regiment, there was
often a good deal of untrustworthy gossip abroad, which
stuck in the memory even after long years had passed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Books of Regimental Adventure</div>

<p>Among all the books of regimental adventure, I should
give the first place for interest and good writing to Lieut.
Grattan’s <cite>With the Connaught Rangers</cite>. It is not too much
to say that if the author had taken to formal history, his
style, which is vivid without exaggeration, and often
dignified without pomposity, would have made him a
worthy rival of Napier as an English classic. His descriptions
of the aspect and psychology of the stormers marching
down to the advanced trenches at Ciudad Rodrigo, and of
the crisis of the battle of Salamanca, are as good as anything
that Napier ever wrote. A reader presented with many of
his paragraphs would say without hesitation that they were
excerpts from the great historian. Unfortunately Grattan
suffered from one of the faults which I have named above—he
<em>will</em> give untrustworthy information about episodes
at which he was not present—it is at best superfluous and
sometimes misleading. But for what the 88th did at
Bussaco and Fuentes, at Badajoz and Salamanca, he is
very good authority. And he is always a pleasure to read.
Two good books—Gleig’s <cite>The Subaltern</cite>, and Moyle Sherer’s
<cite>Recollections of the Peninsula</cite>—have a share of the literary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
merit of Grattan’s work, but lack his power. They give
respectively the day-by-day camp life of the 85th in 1813–14,
and of the 48th in 1811–13, in a pleasant and life-like
fashion, and since both were published within ten years
of the end of the war—Gleig’s in 1825, Sherer’s in 1824—the
writers’ memories were still strong, and their statements
of fact may be relied upon. Both have the merit of sticking
closely to personal experience, and of avoiding second-hand
stories.</p>

<p>Those lively tales of adventure—Kincaid’s <cite>Adventures
in the Rifle Brigade</cite>, Sir Harry Smith’s <cite>Autobiography</cite>,
and Blakeney’s memoir (which its editor called <cite>A Boy in
the Peninsular War</cite>)<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>—were all written at a much later date,
from twenty to thirty years after Waterloo, and show their
remoteness from the time that they describe not so much
by want of detail, nor of picturesque power of description,—all
three authors were good wielders of the pen—as by the
selection of the facts that they record. Much of the every-day
life of the regiment has been forgotten or grown dim,
and only the great days, or the most striking personal experiences,
or quaint and grotesque incidents, are recorded.
This very fact makes them all very good reading—they
contain (so to speak) all the plums of the cake and comparatively
little of the less appetizing crust. Harry Smith’s
chapters are practically the tale of his Odyssey in the campaigns
of 1812–13 along with the heroic little Spanish
wife whom he had picked up and married at the storm of
Badajoz. Kincaid is a humourist—he remembers all the
grotesque incidents, ludicrous situations, practical jokes,
and misadventures, in which he and his comrades were
concerned, and pours them out in a string of anecdotes,
loosely connected by a narrative of which he says that he
refuses to be responsible for the exact sequence or dating.
It is very amusing, and some of the more striking stories
can be verified from other and better authorities. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
the general effect is often as if we were reading a chapter
out of Lever’s <cite>Charles O’Malley</cite>, or some such old-fashioned
Peninsular romance. Blakeney’s book gives a better impression
for solidity, and he fills up many an incident, otherwise
known to us only in outline, with picturesque detail
which bears every appearance of truth. But I have once
or twice found his narrative refusing to square in with
contemporary documents, and when this is the case the
story written twenty-five years after the event must go to
the wall.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> He must be used with caution, though he is
giving a genuine record to the best of his ability.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reminiscences from the Ranks</div>

<p>Nearly all the reminiscences from the ranks are subject
to these same disabilities. With hardly an exception they
were written down long years after the events recorded.
Usually the narrator had no books or notes to help him,
and we get a genuine tale, uninfluenced by outer sources,
but blurred and foreshortened by the lapse of time. The
details of personal adventure are perfectly authentic to the
best of the veteran’s memory; incidents of battle, of camp
hardships, of some famous court-martial and subsequent
punishment-parade, come out in a clear-cut fashion. But
there are long gaps of forgotten months, frequent errors
of dating, and often mistakes in the persons to whom an
exploit, an epigram, or a misadventure are attributed.
Yet these little volumes give the spirit of the rank and file
in the most admirable fashion, and enable us to realize the
inner life of the battalion as no official document can do.
There are a few cases where the author has got hold of a
book, generally Napier’s great history, and to a great
extent spoils his work by letting in passages of incongruous
eloquence, or strategical disquisition, into the homely
stuff of his real reminiscences.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
One soldier’s little volume stands out from all the rest
for its literary merit—it is the work of a man of superior
education, who had enlisted in a moment of pique and
humiliation to avoid facing at home the consequences of
his own conceit and folly. This short story of 150 pages
called <cite>Journal of T. S., a Soldier of the 71st Highland Light
Infantry, 1806–15</cite>, was written down as early as 1818,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
when memory was still fresh. Its value lies in the fact
that the author wrote from the ranks, yet was so different
in education and mental equipment from his comrades,
that he does not take their views and habits for granted,
but proceeds to explain and comment on them. “I could
get,” as he notes, “no pleasure from their amusements, but
found it necessary to humour them in many things, and to
be obliging to all. I was thought saucy, and little courted
by them, they not liking my dry manner as they called it.”
His narrative is that of an intelligent observer of the behaviour
of the regiment, in whose psychology he is deeply
interested, rather than that of a typical soldier. Having
a ready pen and a keen observant eye, he produced a little
book of extraordinary interest. The chronicle of his
marches, and the details of the actions which he relates,
seem very accurate when compared with official documents.</p>

<p>Sergeant Donaldson of the 94th was another notable
Scot whose book, <cite>The Eventful Life of a Soldier</cite>, is well worth
reading. He was not so well educated as T. S., nor had
he the same vivid literary style. But he was an intelligent
man, and possessed a wider set of interests than was
common in the ranks, so that it is always worth while to
look up his notes and observations. His description of
the horrors of Masséna’s retreat from Portugal in 1811 is
a very striking piece of lurid writing. After him may be
mentioned a quartermaster and a sergeant—Surtees and
Costello—both of the Rifle Brigade,—whose reminiscences
are full of typical stories reflecting the virtues and failings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
of the famous Light Division. For the views and ways of
thought of the ordinary private of the better sort, the little
books of “Rifleman Harris,” already cited above, Lawrence
of the 40th, and Cooper of the 7th Fusiliers,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> are valuable
authority. They are admirable evidence for the way in
which the rank and file looked on a battle, a forced march,
or a prolonged shortage of rations. But we must not
trust them overmuch as authorities on the greater matter
of war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Memoirs of French Veterans</div>

<p>There is a considerable bulk of French reminiscences
dealing with the purely British side of the Peninsular
War. Beside Marbot’s and Thiébault’s memoirs, of
which I have already made mention, three or four more
must not be neglected by any one who wishes to see Wellington’s
army from the outside. By far the most vivid
and lively of them is Lemonnier-Delafosse of the 31st Léger,
whose <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Souvenirs Militaires</cite> were published at Havre in 1850.
He is a bitter enemy, and wants to prove that Wellington
was a mediocre general, and ought always to have been
beaten. But he does his best to tell a true tale, and
acknowledges his defeats handsomely—though he thinks
that with better luck they might have been victories.
Failing memory can be detected in one or two places, where
he makes an officer fall at the wrong battle, or misnames
a village. Fantin des Odoards, also (oddly enough) of the
31st Léger, kept a journal, so that his reminiscences of
1808–11 are very accurate. He is specially valuable
for Moore’s retreat and Soult’s Oporto campaign. A far
more fair-minded man than Delafosse, he is full of acknowledgments
of the merit of his British adversaries, and makes
no secret of his disgust for the Spanish war,—a nightmare
of plunder and military executions naturally resulting from
an unjust aggression. A third valuable author is Colonel St.
Chamans, an aide-de-camp of Soult, whom he cordially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
detested, and whose meanness and spirit of intrigue he is
fond of exposing. He is of a light and humorous spirit—very
different from another aide-de-camp, Ney’s Swiss
follower, Sprünglin, whose journal<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> is a most solid and heavy
production, of value for minute facts and figures but not
lively. Unlike St. Chamans in another respect, he is devoted
to his chief, the Marshal, of whom he was the most loyal
admirer. But I imagine that Ney was a much more
generous and loveable master than the wily Soult.</p>

<p>Other useful French volumes of reminiscences are those
of Guingret of the 6th corps, full of horrible details of
Masséna’s Portuguese misfortunes; of D’Illens, a cavalry
officer who served against Moore and Wellesley in 1808–09;
and of Vigo-Roussillon, of the 8th Line, who gives the only
good French narrative of Barrosa. Parquin is a mere
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sabreur</i>, who wrote his memoir too late, and whose anecdotes
cannot be trusted. He survived to be one of the followers
of Napoleon III. in his early and unhappy adventures at
Boulogne and elsewhere. Other French writers, such as
Rocca and Gonneville, were long in Spain, but little in contact
with the British, being employed on the Catalan coast,
or with the army of the South on the Granada side. So
much for the works of actors in the Great War, who relate
what they have themselves seen. We need spend but a
much smaller space on the books of the later generations,
which are but second-hand information, however carefully
they may have been compiled.</p>

<p>The British regimental histories ought to be of great
value, since the series compiled by the order of the Horse
Guards, under the general editorship of Richard Cannon, in
the 1830’s, might have been enriched by the information
obtainable from hundreds of Peninsular veterans, who were
still surviving. Unfortunately nearly every volume of it
is no more than bad hack-work. In the majority of the
volumes we find nothing more than copious extracts from
Napier, eked out with reprints of the formal reports<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
taken from the <cite>London Gazette</cite>. It is quite exceptional to
find even regimental statistics, such as might have been
obtained with ease from the pay-lists and other documents
in possession of the battalion, or stored at the Record Office.
Details obtained through enquiry from veteran officers who
had served through the war are quite exceptional. Some
of his volumes are less arid and jejune than others—and
this is about all that can be said in favour of even the best
of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Regimental Histories</div>

<p>All the good regimental histories, without exception,
are outside the official “Cannon” series. Some are excellent;
it may be said that, as a general rule, those written
latest are the best: the standard of accuracy and original
research has been rising ever since 1860. Among those
which deserve a special word of praise are Colonel Gardyne’s
admirable <cite>The Life of a Regiment</cite> (the Gordon Highlanders),
published in 1901; Cope’s <cite>History of the Rifle Brigade</cite>
(full of excerpts from first-hand authorities) which came out
in 1877; Moorsom’s <cite>History of the 52nd Oxfordshire Light
Infantry</cite> (the first really good regimental history which was
written), published in 1860; Davis’s <cite>History of the 2nd Foot</cite>
(Queen’s West Surrey), and Colonel Hamilton’s <cite>14th Hussars</cite>.
By the time that these began to appear, the level of research
was beginning to rise, and it was no longer considered
superfluous to visit the Record Office, or to make enquiries
for unpublished papers among the families of old officers.
All those mentioned above are large volumes, but even the
smaller histories are now compiled with care, and their
size is generally the result not of scamped work (as of old),
but of the fact that some regiments have, by the chance of
their stations, seen less service than others, and therefore
have less to record. I may mention as books on the smaller
scale which have proved useful to me, Hayden’s history
of the 76th, Smyth’s of the 20th, and Purdon’s of the 47th.
A rare example of the annals of a smaller unit, a battery
not a battalion, is Colonel Whinyates’ story of C Troop,
R.H.A., which he called <cite>From Corunna to Sebastopol</cite>, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
which much loyal and conscientious work may be found.
But the history of the whole of the Artillery of the Peninsular
Army, Portuguese as well as English, is now being worked
out in admirable detail in the <cite>Dickson Papers</cite>, edited by
Major John Leslie, R.A., who knows everything that can
be known about the units of his corps which served under
Wellington. Sir Alexander Dickson, it may be remarked,
was Commanding Officer of the Artillery in the later
campaigns of 1813 and in 1814, and before he obtained that
post had been in charge of all the three sieges of Badajoz
as well as those of Olivenza and Ciudad Rodrigo. Since he
had been lent to the Portuguese artillery, his papers give
copious information as to the auxiliary batteries of that
nation which were attached to the Peninsular Army. It
is devoutly to be wished that some officer would take up
a corresponding task by compiling the annals of the Royal
Engineers in the Peninsular War. Connolly’s <cite>History of
the Royal Sappers and Miners</cite> (published so far back as
1857), has much good information, but infinitely more
could be compiled by searching the Record Office, and
collating the memoirs of Boothby, Burgoyne, Landmann,
and other engineer officers who have left journals or
reminiscences.</p>

<p>Along with the British regimental histories should be
named two sets of volumes which are of the same type,
though they relate to larger units than a regiment, and do
not deal with our own troops. The first class deals with
our German auxiliaries, and is headed by Major Ludlow
Beamish’s valuable and conscientious <cite>History of the King’s
German Legion</cite>. This was written in 1832, but is a very
favourable example of research for a book of the date, when
Cannon’s miserable series represented the level of English
regimental history. The two volumes contain many original
letters and documents, and some excellent plates of uniforms.
In 1907 Captain Schwertfeger went over the same
ground in his <cite xml:lang="de" lang="de">Geschichte der Königlich Deutschen Legion</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
and added appreciably to Beamish’s store of facts. The
Brunswick Oels regiment, which served Wellington from
1811 to 1814, has also a German biographer in Colonel Kortfleisch,
who has served in the 88th German Infantry, which
now represents that ancient corps. There is no similar
history for the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Chasseurs Brittaniques</i>, the last of the old
Peninsular foreign corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Portuguese Authorities</div>

<p>For the Portuguese Army a good description of the
state of affairs in 1810, when it had just been reorganized,
is contained in Halliday’s <cite>Present State of Portugal</cite>, published
in 1812. Chaby’s <cite xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Excerptos Historicos</cite><a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> contains a good deal
of valuable material for its subsequent history, but is sadly
ill-arranged and patchy. Only the Portuguese artillery in
the Peninsular War has been dealt with in Major Teixeira
Botelho’s <cite xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Subsidios para a Historia da Artilheria Portegueza</cite>,
which is very full and well documented. The life of a
British officer serving with a Portuguese regiment can be
studied in the <cite>Memoirs of Bunbury</cite> (20th Line),<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> and
Blakiston (5th Caçadores).<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>After regimental histories, the next most important
source of information, in the way of books not written by
those who served under Wellington, is personal biographies.
Captain Delavoye’s <cite>Life of Lord Lynedoch</cite> (Sir Thomas
Graham)<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> is perhaps the most useful among them, not so
much for any merit of style or arrangement, as for the
excellent use of contemporary documents not available
elsewhere. A large portion of the volume consists of
excerpts from Graham’s long and interesting military
journal, and letters from and to him are printed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in extenso</i>.
Thus we get first-hand information on many events at
which no other British witness was present, <i>e.g.</i> Castaños’
campaign on the Ebro in 1808, as well as comments on
better known operations, such as Sir John Moore’s Corunna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
retreat, and the Barrosa expedition of 1811. Unfortunately
both journal and letters fail for the campaign of 1813, in
which Graham took such a distinguished part.</p>

<p>H. B. Robinson’s <cite>Memoirs of Sir Thomas Picton</cite><a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> was
a book of which Napier fell foul—there are many caustic
comments on it in his controversial appendices. But it
is not nearly so bad a work as might have been expected
from his way of treating it. Indeed I fancy that Napier
was paying off an old Light Division grudge against Picton
himself, whom he personally disliked. The narrative is
fair, and the quantity of contemporary letters inserted give
the compilation some value. Sidney’s <cite>Life of Lord Hill</cite><a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
is far inferior to Robinson’s book: the author did not know
his Peninsular War well enough to justify the task which
he took in hand, and the letters, of which he fortunately
prints a good many, are the only valuable material in it. It
is curious that both Picton and Hill had their lives written
by clergymen, when there were still a good many old Peninsular
officers surviving who might have undertaken the
task.</p>

<p>Of the other chief lieutenants of Wellington, Beresford
has never found a biographer, though the part which he
played in the war was so important. There must be an
immense accumulation of his papers somewhere, in private
hands, but I do not know where they lie. The only account
of him consists of a few pages in a useful but rather formal
and patchy little book by J. W. Cole, entitled, <cite>Memoirs of
British Generals Distinguished during the Peninsular War</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>
Lord Combermere (Stapleton Cotton) was in high command
throughout Wellington’s campaigns, but was hardly up
to his position, though he earned his chief’s tolerance by
strict obedience to orders, a greater merit in the Duke’s
eyes than military genius or initiative. There is a biography
of him by Lady Combermere and Captain W. Knollys (1866)
but the Peninsular chapters are short. Of Sir Lowry Cole, Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
John Gaspard Le Marchant, and several other prominent
divisional generals and brigadiers, the only biographies are
those in J. W. Cole’s book mentioned above. Sir James
Leith, more fortunate, had a small volume dedicated to
his memory by an anonymous admirer in 1818, but it
was written without sufficient material, Leith’s private
correspondence not (as it seems) being in the author’s hands,
while official documents were not for the most part available
at such an early date. There is a good deal, however,
concerning this hard-fighting general’s personality and
adventures to be gleaned from the memoirs of his nephew
and aide-de-camp, Leith Hay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Biographies of Gough, Colborne, etc.</div>

<p>Of officers who did not attain to the highest rank under
Wellington, but who in later years made a great career for
themselves, there are two biographies which devote a large
section to Peninsular matters, those of Lord Gough by
R. S. Rait (two vols., 1903), and of Lord Seaton (Colborne
of the 52nd) by Moore Smith. These are both excellent
productions, which give much private correspondence of
the time, and have been constructed on modern lines, with
full attention to all possible sources first- and second-hand.
They are both indispensable for any one who wishes to make
a detailed study of the Peninsular campaigns. There are
also short memoirs of Sir Denis Pack<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> and Lord Vivian,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
each produced by a grandson of the general, and giving
useful extracts from journals and correspondence. The
campaign of Sir John Moore can, perhaps, hardly be considered
as falling into the story of Wellington’s army, but
it is impossible to avoid mentioning the full (and highly
controversial) biography of the hero of Corunna by Sir
J. F. Maurice,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> which contains an invaluable diary, and
much correspondence. It is an indispensable volume, at
any rate, for those who wish to study the first year of the
Peninsular War, and to mark the difference between the
personalities and military theories of Moore and Wellington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
Of formal and detailed histories of the Peninsular War
written in recent years there is one in Spanish by General
Arteche, a very conscientious and thorough-going worker
at original documents, who got up a good many English
authorities, but by no means all. For the Spanish version
of the whole war he is absolutely necessary. So, for the
Portuguese version, is the immense work of Soriano da
Luz, which is largely founded on Napier, but often differs
from him, and brings many unpublished documents to light.
Colonel Balagny has started a history of the war in French
on a very large scale, delightfully documented, and showing
admirable research. In five volumes he has only just got
into 1809, so the whole book will be a large one. Mr. Fortescue’s
fine history of the British Army has just started
on the Peninsular campaign in its last volume. To my
own four volumes, soon I hope to be five, I need only allude
in passing. There is one immense monograph on Dupont’s
Campaign by a French author, Colonel Titeux, which does
not touch English military affairs at all. Two smaller but
good works of the same type by Colonel Dumas and Commandant
Clerc are both, oddly enough, dedicated to the
same campaign,—Soult’s defence of the Pyrenean frontier
in 1813–14: the former is the better of the two: both have
endeavoured, in the modern fashion, to use the reports of
both sides, not to write from the documents of one only;
but Dumas has a better knowledge of his English sources
than Clerc.</p>

<p>It is beyond my power to guess why similar monographs
on separate campaigns of the war do not appear in English
also. But the few <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">brochures</i> purporting to treat of such
which have appeared of late on this side of the channel,
are mostly cram-books for examinations, resting on no wide
knowledge of sources, and often consisting of little more
than an analysis of Napier, with some supplementary comments
hazarded. They contrast very unfavourably with a
book such as that of Colonel Dumas.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON—THE MAN AND THE STRATEGIST</span></h2>
</div>

<p>So much for our sources. We may now proceed to discover
what we can deduce from them. And we must inevitably
begin with a consideration of the great leader of the British
army. I am not writing a life of Wellington, still less a
commentary on his campaigns—with which I am trying
to deal elsewhere. My object is rather to paint him as he
appeared to his own army, and as his acts and his writings
reveal him during the course of his Peninsular campaigns.
The Arthur Wellesley of 1809 is difficult to disentangle in
our own memories from the familiar figure of Victorian
reminiscences. We think of him as the “Great Duke,”
the first and most honoured subject of the crown, round
whom centre so many stories, more or less well founded,
illustrating his disinterestedness, his hatred of phrases,
insincerities, sentiment, and humbug generally, his punctiliousness,
his bleak frugality, and his occasional scathing
directness of speech—for he could never “suffer fools
gladly.” He had become a legend long before he died,
and it takes an effort of mind to differentiate the old man
of 1850 from the general of 1809, who had still, in the eyes
of most men, his reputation to make. For those who understood
the greatness of his Indian exploits were few. It
was not Napoleon only who thought that to call Wellesley
a “sepoy general” was sufficient to reduce his reputation
to that of a facile victor over contemptible enemies.</p>

<p>When he took command of the Peninsular Army in the
April of that year, Arthur Wellesley was thirty-nine: he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
had just reached early middle age. He was a slight but
wiry man of middle stature, well built and erect, with a
long face, an aquiline nose, and a keen but cold grey eye.
His reputation as a soldier was already high; but few save
those who had served under him in India understood the
full scope of his abilities. Many undervalued him, because
he was a member of a well-known, but ill-loved family
and political group, and had owed his early promotion and
opportunities of distinguishing himself to that fact. It
was still open to critics to say that the man who had commanded
a battalion in the old Revolutionary War at the
age of twenty-three, and who had headed an army in India
before he was quite thirty, had got further to the front
than he deserved by political influence. And it was true
(though the fact is so often forgotten), that in his early
years he had got much help from his connections, that he
had obtained his unique chance in India because he was
the brother of a viceroy, and that since his return from the
East he had been more of a politician than a general. Was
he not, even when he won Vimeiro, Secretary for Ireland in
the Tory government of the day? It was a post whose
holder had to dabble in much dirty work, when dealing
with the needy peers, the grovelling place-mongers, and
the intriguing lawyers of Dublin. Wellesley went through
with it all, and not by any means in a conciliatory way.
He passed the necessary jobs, but did not hide from the
jobbers his scorn for them. When the Secretary for Ireland
had to deal with any one whom he disliked, he showed a
happy mixture of aristocratic hauteur and cold intellectual
contempt, which sent the petitioner away in a bitter frame
of mind, whether his petition had been granted or no.
Unfortunately, he carried this manner from the Irish
Secretaryship on to the Headquarters of the Peninsular
Army. It did not tend to make him loved.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington and the Whigs</div>

<p>Fortunately for Great Britain, it does not always follow
that, because a man has been pushed rapidly to the front
by political influence, he is therefore incompetent or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
unworthy of the place given him. Every one who came into
personal contact with Arthur Wellesley soon recognized
that Castlereagh and the other ministers had not erred
when they sent the “Sepoy General” to Portugal in 1808,
and when they, despite of all the clamour following the
Convention of Cintra, despatched him a second time to
Lisbon in 1809, this time with full control of the Peninsular
Army. From the first opening of his Vimeiro campaign
the troops that he led had the firmest confidence in him—they
saw the skill with which he handled them, and criticism
very soon died away. It was left for Whig politicians at
home, carpers with not the slightest knowledge of war, to
go on asserting for a couple of years more that he was an
over-rated officer, that he was rash and reckless, and that
his leadership would end, on some not very distant day,
with the expulsion of the British army from the Peninsula.
At the front there were very few such doubters—though
contemporary letters have proved to me that one or two
were to be found.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>To say that Wellington from the first was trusted alike
by his officers and his men, is by no means to say that he
was loved by them. He did everything that could win
confidence, but little that could attract affection. They
recognized that he was marvellously capable, but that he
was without the supreme gift of sympathy for others.
“The sight of his long nose among us,” wrote one of his
veterans, “was worth ten thousand men any day of the
week. I will venture to say that there was not a heart in
the army which did not beat more lightly when we heard
the joyful news of his arrival.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> But this does not mean
that he was regarded with an enthusiasm of the emotional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
and affectionate sort. Another Light Division officer
sums up the position in the coldest words that I have ever
seen applied to the relations of a great general with his
victorious army. “I know that it has been said that
Wellington was unpopular with the army. Now I can
assert with respect to the Light Division that the troops
<em>rather liked him than otherwise</em>.... Although Wellington
was not what may be called popular, still the troops possessed
great confidence in him, nor did I ever hear a single
individual express an opinion to the contrary.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>There must, indeed, have been something to repel
enthusiasm and affection in the leader of whom, after five
years of victories won and hardships suffered in common,
it could be said that his troops “rather liked him than
otherwise.” But they found that he was a hard master,
slow to praise and swift to blame and to punish. Though
he knew the military virtues of his rank and file, and
acknowledged that they had more than once “got him out
of a scrape” by performing the almost impossible, he did
not love them. He has left on record unpardonable words
concerning his men. “They are the scum of the earth.
English soldiers are fellows who have enlisted for drink—that
is the plain fact: they have <em>all</em> enlisted for drink.”<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
Quite as bad in spirit is one of his sayings before a Royal
Commission on the Army. “I have no idea of any great
effect being produced on British soldiers by anything but
the fear of immediate corporal punishment.” Naturally
enough a leader with such views never appealed to the
better side of his men: he never spoke or wrote about
honour or patriotism to them, but frequently reminded
them of the lash and the firing-party, that were the
inevitable penalty for the straggler, the drunkard, the
plunderer, and the deserter. Nothing cooled the spirits of
officers and men alike more than the strength and vigour
of his rebukes, as compared with the official formality of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
his terms of praise. It was possible to have a full appreciation
of his marvellous powers of brain, and a complete
confidence in him as a leader, without feeling the least
touch of affection for this hard and unsympathetic figure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington and his Men</div>

<p>The distressing point in all this is that the Peninsular
Army, though it had its proportion of hardened sots and
criminals, was full of good soldiers who knew what honour
and loyalty meant, and were perfectly capable of answering
any stirring appeal to their heart or their brain. There
are dozens of diaries and autobiographies written in the
ranks which show the existence of a vast class of well-conditioned
intelligent, sober, even religious men, who were
doing their work conscientiously, and would have valued
a word of praise—they often got it from their regimental
officers—seldom from their commander-in-chief. And we
may add that if anything was calculated to brutalize an
army it was the wicked cruelty of the British military
punishment code, which Wellington to the end of his life
supported. There is plenty of authority for the fact that
the man who had once received his 500 lashes for a fault
which was small, or which involved no moral guilt, was
often turned thereby from a good into a bad soldier, by
losing his self-respect and having his sense of justice seared
out. Good officers knew this well enough, and did their
best to avoid the cat-of-nine-tails, and to try more rational
means—more often than not with success.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>It might have been expected that Wellington would at
least show more regard for the feelings of his officers, however
much he might contemn his rank and file. As a rule
he did not. He had some few intimates whom he treated
with a certain familiarity, and it is clear that he showed
consideration and even kindness to his aides-de-camp
and other personal retainers. But to the great majority
of his officers, even to many of his generals and heads of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
departments, he bore himself very stiffly: he would administer
to them humiliating snubs or reproofs before others, and
ignore their remarks or proffered counsel in the most marked
way. A few examples may serve. Sir Thomas Picton
was one of his most distinguished lieutenants, and was
specially summoned by him to come over to Brussels to
take his part in the campaign of 1815. The moment that
he arrived in the Belgian capital he sought the Duke, who
was walking in the Great Park. We have the witness of
Picton’s aide-de-camp for the following reception. “The
general’s manner was always more familiar than the Duke
liked in his lieutenants, and on this occasion he approached
him in a careless sort of way, just as he might have greeted
an equal. The Duke bowed coldly to him, and said, ‘I
am glad you are come, Sir Thomas. The sooner you get
on horseback the better: no time to be lost. You will
take the command of the troops in advance.’ That was all.
Picton appeared not to like the Duke’s manner, and when
he had bowed and left, he muttered words which convinced
those who were with him that he was not much pleased
with his interview.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Such was the welcome vouchsafed
to one of the best officers in the army, whom Wellington
had specially sent for, and whom he had not seen for a long
space of time. Another picture of Wellington’s manners
may be taken from the memoir of one of his departmental
chiefs, Sir James McGrigor. “One morning I was in his
lordship’s small room, when two officers came to request
leave to go home to England. An engineer captain first
made his request: he had received letters informing him that
his wife was dangerously ill, and that the whole of his family
were sick. His lordship quickly replied, ‘No, no, sir. I
cannot spare you at this moment.’ The captain, with a
mournful face, drew back. Then a general officer, of noble
family, commanding a brigade, advanced saying, ‘My
lord, I have lately been suffering much from rheumatism——’.
Without allowing him time to complete his sentence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
Lord Wellington rapidly said, ‘and you want to go to
England to be cured. By all means. Go there immediately.’
The general, surprised at his lordship’s tone and
manner, looked abashed, but to prevent his saying anything
more, his lordship turned and began to address me, enquiring
about the casualty-returns of the preceding night,
and the nature of them.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> An interview with the commander-in-chief
was such a trying thing for the nerves
that some officers went away from it in a flood of tears—as
did Charles Stewart after one famous reproof—and others
suffocating from suppressed maledictions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington and his Officers</div>

<p>Wellington’s temper was tried by having to deal with
some inefficient and slack officers—foisted upon him from
home—for never till the end of the war (as he bitterly complained)
was he allowed complete liberty in choosing his
subordinates. But it was not on them alone that his
thunders fell. He often raged at zealous and capable
subordinates, who had done no more than think for themselves
in an urgent crisis, when the orders that they had
received seemed no longer applicable. Sir James McGrigor,
whom I have just quoted above, once moved some commissariat
stores to Salamanca, where there was a great
accumulation of sick and wounded. “When I came to
inform him his lordship started up, and in a violent manner
began to repudiate what I had done. ‘I shall be glad to
know,’ he asked, ‘who commands this army—I or you?
I establish one route, one line of communication—you
establish another by ordering up supplies by it. As long
as you live, sir, never do that again. Never do <em>anything</em>
without my orders.’ I pleaded that there had been no
time to consult him, and that I had to save lives. He
peremptorily desired me ‘never again to act without his
orders.’” Three months afterwards McGrigor ventured to
say, “My lord, you will remember how much you blamed
me at Madrid, for the steps that I took when I could not
consult your lordship, and acted for myself. Now, if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
had not, what would the consequences have been?” He
answered, “It is all right as it has turned out, but still I
recommend you to <em>have my orders for what you do</em>.” This
was a singular feature in his lordship’s character.</p>

<p>Anything that seemed to Wellington to partake of the
nature of thinking for oneself was an unpardonable sin in
a subordinate. This is why he preferred blind obedience
in his lieutenants to zeal and energy which might lead to
some contravention of his own intention. Thus it came
that he preferred as lieutenants not only Hill, who was a
man of first-class brain-power notwithstanding his docility,
but Spencer and Beresford, who most certainly were not.
Hence, too, his commission of the cavalry arm throughout
the war to such a mediocre personage as Stapleton Cotton
(of whom he used the most unflattering language).<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> These
men could be trusted to obey without reasoning, while
Robert Craufurd, the ablest general in the Peninsula, or
Picton, could not, but were liable to think for themselves.
It may be noted that Hill, Beresford, Graham and Craufurd,
were the only officers to whom Wellington ever condescended
in his correspondence to give the why and
wherefore of a command that he issued: the others simply
received orders without any commentary. There are
instances known in which a word of reasonable explanation
to a subordinate would have enabled him to understand a
situation, and to comprehend why directions otherwise
incomprehensible were given him. Tiresome results occasionally
followed. This foible of refusing information to
subordinates for no adequate reason has been shared by
other great generals—<i>e.g.</i> by Stonewall Jackson, as Colonel
Henderson’s biography of that strange genius sufficiently
shows. It is a trick of the autocratic mind.</p>

<p>It hardly requires to be pointed out that this determination
to allow no liberty of action to his lieutenants, and to
keep even small decisions in his own hands, effectually prevented
Wellington from forming a school of generals capable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
of carrying out large independent operations. He trained
admirable divisional commanders, but not leaders of armies.
The springs of self-confidence were drained out of men who
had for long been subjected to his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington’s Dispatches</div>

<p>Probably the thing which irritated Wellington’s subordinates
most was his habit of making his official mention
of names in dispatches little more than a formal recital
in order of the senior officers present. Where grave
mistakes had been committed, he still stuck the names
of the misdemeanants in the list, among those of the men
who had really done the work. A complete mystification
as to their relative merits would be produced, if we had only
the dispatches to read, and no external commentary on
them. He honourably mentioned Murray in his Oporto
dispatch, Erskine in his dispatch concerning the actions
during Masséna’s retreat in 1811, Trip in his Waterloo dispatch,
though each of these officers had done his best to spoil
the operations in which he was concerned. On the other
hand, he would make the most unaccountable omissions:
his Fuentes de Oñoro dispatch makes no mention of the
British artillery, which had done most brilliant service in
that battle, not merely in the matter of Norman Ramsay’s
well-known exploit, which Wellington might have thought
too small a matter to mention, but in the decisive checking
of the main French attack. There are extant heart-rending
letters from the senior officers commanding the artillery,
deploring the way in which they have been completely
ignored: “to read the dispatch, there might have been no
British artillery present at all.” A similar inexplicable
omission of any record of zealous service occurs in Wellington’s
dispatch recording the fall of Badajoz, where no
special praise of the services of his engineer officers is made,
though 50 per cent. of them had been killed or wounded
during the siege. “You may suppose we all feel hurt at
finding our exertions have not been deemed worthy of any
sort of eulogium,” writes John Jones, the historian of the
sieges of the Peninsula, to one of his colleagues. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Fletcher, the commanding engineer, writes to a friend:
“You will observe that Lord W. has not mentioned the
engineers in the late actions: how I hate such capriciousness!”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
The cold phrase in which their desperate service
was acknowledged is “the officers and men of the corps
of engineers and artillery were equally distinguished during
the operations of the siege and its close.” Fletcher would
gladly have exchanged the personal honour of a decoration,
which was given him along with other senior officers, for
three lines of warm praise of the exertions of his subordinates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Roberts on Wellington</div>

<p>Perhaps, however, the most astounding instance of
Wellington’s ungracious omissions is that his famous
Waterloo dispatch contains no mention whatever of the
services of Colborne and the 52nd, the battalion which
gave the decisive stroke against the flank of the Imperial
Guard, during Napoleon’s last desperate assault on the
British line. Colborne, the most unselfish and generous
of men, could never forget this slight. He tried to
excuse it, saying, “dispatches are written in haste, and
it is impossible for a general to do justice to his army.”
And when he heard his officers complaining that the
British Guards had been given all the credit for the final
repulse of the French column, he said, “For shame,
gentlemen! One would think that you forgot that the
52nd had ever been in battle before.” But there was
a bitter comment in the table talk of his later years.
“The Duke was occasionally not above writing in his
dispatches to please the aristocracy.... I don’t mean
to say that this was peculiar to him. It used to be a
common thing with general officers.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> Enough, however,
of these illustrative anecdotes of the limitations of a very
great soldier and a very honourable man. They have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
to be mentioned in order to explain how it came to pass
that Wellington was implicitly trusted, and never loved.
But they compel me to acquiesce in the hard judgment
which Lord Roberts wrote in his <cite>Rise of Wellington</cite>—“the
more we go into his actions and his writings in detail,
the more do we respect and admire him as a general, and the
less do we like him as a man.” I conclude this paragraph
with two quotations from two eloquent writers who served
through long years of the Peninsular campaigns. “Thus
terminated the war, and with it all remembrances of the
veteran’s services” are the last words of William Napier’s
penultimate chapter.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> Grattan of the 88th, a forgotten
writer now, but one who wielded a descriptive pen no less
vivid than Napier’s, puts the complaint more bitterly.
“In his parting General Order to the Peninsular Army he
told us that he would never cease to feel the warmest
interest for our welfare and honour. How that promise
has been kept every one knows. That the Duke of Wellington
is one of the most remarkable (perhaps the greatest)
men of the present age, few will deny. But that he
neglected the interests and feelings of his Peninsular army,
as a body, is beyond all question. And were he in his grave
to-morrow, hundreds of voices that now are silent would
echo what I write.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p>If I have dwelt perhaps at over-great length on the
limitations of Wellington’s heart, it is only fair that full credit
should be given to his wonderful powers of brain. To comprehend
the actual merit of his military career, it is not
sufficient to possess a mere knowledge of the details of his
tactics and his strategy. The conditions under which he
had to exercise his talents were exceptionally trying and
difficult. When he assumed command at Lisbon on April
22, 1809, the French were in possession of all Northern and
Central Spain, and of no inconsiderable part of Northern
Portugal also. The Spanish armies had all been dashed to
pieces—there was no single one of them which had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
suffered a crushing defeat, and some of them (such as
Cuesta’s army of Estremadura, and La Romana’s army of
Galicia) were at the moment little better than wandering
bands of fugitives. The British army of which Wellesley
took command when he landed at Lisbon, though it only
mustered 19,000 men present, or 21,000 including men in
hospital, was the only solid force, in good order and intact
in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">morale</i>, on which the allies could count in the Iberian
Peninsula. The task set before Wellesley was to see if
he could defend Portugal, and co-operate in the protection
of Southern Spain, it being obvious that the French were
in vastly superior numbers, and well able to take the
offensive if they should chose to do so. There were two
armies threatening Lisbon. The one under Soult had
already captured Oporto and overrun two Portuguese provinces,
shortly before Wellesley’s landing. The other, under
Victor, lay in Estremadura close to the Portuguese border,
and had recently destroyed the largest surviving Spanish
army at the battle of Medellin on March 28. Was it
possible that 19,000 British troops could save the Peninsula
from conquest, or even that they could keep up the war
in Central Portugal? Never was a more unpromising task
set to the commander of a small army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington’s Powers of Prescience</div>

<p>Fortunately we possess three documents from Wellesley’s
own hand, which show us the way in which he surveyed the
position that was before him, and stated his views as to the
future course of the Peninsular War. He recognized that
it was about to be a very long business, and that his task
was simply to keep the war going as long as possible, with
the limited resources at his disposition. Ambitious schemes
for the expulsion of the French from the whole Peninsula
were in 1809 perfectly futile. The hypothesis which he
sets forth in the first of the three documents to which I
allude, his <cite>Memorandum on the Defence of Portugal</cite>, laid
before Castlereagh on March 7, before he had taken ship
for Lisbon, is a marvel of prophetic genius. No more
prescient document was ever written. Rejecting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
decision of Sir John Moore, who had declared that Portugal
was quite indefensible, Wellesley states that a British army
of not less than 30,000 men, backed by the levies of Portugal,
ought to be able to maintain itself for an almost indefinite
period on the flank of the French army in Spain. Its presence
on the Tagus would paralyse all offensive movements
of the enemy, and enable the Spaniards to make head in
the unsubdued provinces of their realm, so long as Portugal
should remain intact. The French ought, if they were
wise, to turn all their disposable forces against the British
army and Portugal, but he believed that even then, when
the geography of the country was taken into consideration,
they would fail in their attempt to overrun it. They could
not succeed, as he held, unless they were able to set aside
100,000 men for the task, and he did not see how in the
spring of 1809 they could spare such a large detachment,
out of the forces which they then possessed in the Peninsula.
If they tried it with a smaller army, he thought
that he could undertake to foil them. He believed that
he could cope with Soult and Victor, the two enemies who
immediately threatened Portugal.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>Further forward it was impossible to look. If a war
should break out between Napoleon and Austria, as seemed
likely at the moment in March, 1809, to one who (like himself)
was in the secrets of the British Cabinet, the Emperor
would not be able to send reinforcements to Spain for
many a day. But, even so, the position of the French in
the Peninsula was so strong that it could only be endangered
if a very large allied force, acting in unison under
the guidance of a single general, should be brought to bear
upon them. Of the collection of such a force, and still
more of the possibility of its being entrusted to his own
command, there was as yet no question. Wellesley was
aware of the jealousy of foreign interference which the
Spanish Junta nurtured: there was little probability that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
they would entrust him with the supreme control over
their armies. It was, indeed, only in 1812, when he had
acquired for himself a much greater reputation than he
owned in 1809, and when the Spanish Government had
drunk the cup of humiliation to the dregs, that he was
finally given the position of commander-in-chief of the
Spanish armies.</p>

<p>This memorandum is a truly inspired document, which
shows Wellesley at his best. It is not too much to say that
it predicts the whole course of the Peninsular War—whose
central point was to be invasion of Portugal in 1810 by a
French army of 65,000 instead of the required 100,000 men,
and that army, as he had foreseen, Wellesley was able to
check and foil.</p>

<p>The second document of a prophetic sort that we have
to notice is Wellesley’s reply to Mr. Canning’s question to
him as regards the future general policy of the war, written
on September 5, 1809. The whole aspect of affairs had
been much changed since March, by the fact that Austria
had tried her luck in a war against Napoleon, and had
been beaten at Wagram and forced to make peace. It
was therefore certain that the Emperor would now have
his hands free again, and be able to reinforce his armies
in the Peninsula. Wellesley replies that it is hopeless
to attempt to defend both Southern Spain and Portugal
also, even if the British army were raised to 40,000 men.
But Portugal can still be defended.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> He expresses the
strongest objection to any attempt to cover Andalusia and
Seville, for to endeavour to do so must mean that Lisbon
would have to be given up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lines of Torres Vedras</div>

<p>The third great prophetic despatch is the Memorandum
of October 26, 1809, ordering the construction of the Lines
of Torres Vedras. Wellesley looks a full year ahead. He
sees that Napoleon can now reinforce his Spanish armies,
but that the new troops cannot get up till the next spring.
When they appear, the British army will have to retreat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
on Lisbon, where lines of such strength can be planned
that there is a good prospect of bringing the invaders
to a stand. Meanwhile the countryside shall be cleared
of population and provisions, so that the French, if they
keep concentrated, must starve, and the allied army shall
so conduct its operations that the enemy will be compelled
to remain <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i>. Then follow directions to Colonel
Fletcher (commanding the engineers) to make his plans
for an immense line of redoubts covering the Lisbon peninsula
from sea to sea. What was foreseen came to pass: the
French reinforcements arrived: the invasion of Portugal
under Masséna took place in 1810. But the whole countryside
was swept clear of food, and when the marshal reached
the Lines with his half-starved army, he was completely
blocked, refused to attack the formidable positions, and,
after a few weeks of endurance in front of them, withdrew
with his famished troops. It was on October 26, 1809,
that Wellington ordered the Lines to be laid out. On
October 14, 1810, Masséna appeared in front of them and
was foiled: Wellington had made his preparations exactly
a year ahead!</p>

<p>Careful long-sighted calculation was perhaps the Duke’s
strongest point. He had an immense grasp of detail,
kept intelligence officers of picked ability out on every
front, and had compiled an almost exactly correct muster-roll
of the forces opposed to him. Seldom had a general
of his time such a complete knowledge of his adversaries,
and this he owed to the pains that he took to obtain it.
His great scouts Colquhoun Grant,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Waters, and Rumann
were always far out to the front, often within the French
lines, sending him daily information, which he filed and
dissected. In addition he had many Spanish and Portuguese
correspondents, whose information would have been
more valuable if it had not contained too much hearsay,
and if they had been able to judge numbers with the trained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
eye of a soldier. Once he complained that he and Marmont
were almost equally handicapped as regards information
from the natives—for if the Frenchmen got none, he himself
got too much: the proportion of it which was inaccurate
spoiled the value of the rest. But Grant or Waters never
made mistakes. Part of his system was the cross-questioning
of every deserter and prisoner as to the number
and brigading of his regiment, and the amount of battalions
that it contained. By constant comparison of these reports
he got to know the exact number of units in every French
corps, and their average strength.</p>

<p>But this was less important than his faculty for judging
the individual characters of his opponents. After a few
weeks he got his fixed opinion on Masséna or Victor, Soult
or Marmont, and would lay his plans with careful reference
to their particular foibles. I think that this is what he
meant when he once observed that his own merit was, perhaps,
that he knew more of “what was going on upon
the other side of the hill,”—in the invisible ground occupied
by the enemy and hidden by the fog of war—than most
men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington’s Insight into Character</div>

<p>This insight into the enemy’s probable move, when their
strength, their object, and the personal tendencies of their
leader were known, was a most valuable part of Wellesley’s
mental equipment. The best known instance where it
came into play was on the day of Sorauren. In the midst
of the battles of the Pyrenees, when the British army had
taken up its fighting position, though its numbers were as
yet by no means complete, and two divisions were still
marching up, Wellington arrived from the west to assume
command. He could see Soult on the opposite hill surrounded
by his staff, and it was equally certain that Soult
could see him, and knew the reason of the cheer which ran
along the front of the allied army as he rode up. Wellington
judged, and rightly, that the news of his arrival, and the
sight of him in position, would cause the marshal to delay
his attack till the last of the French reserves had come on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
the field. “I had an excellent glass: I saw him spying
at us—then write and send off a letter: <em>I knew what he would
be writing</em>, and gave my orders accordingly.”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> Wellington
judged Soult a cautious general, knew that his own presence
would redouble his caution, and so judged that the order
given by the marshal would be for the checking of a
threatened attack, which would have been very dangerous
at the moment, if it had been pressed. “The 6th Division
will have time to come up, and we shall beat him,” is said
to have been his comment, when he saw Soult hurriedly
write and dispatch an order to his front line.</p>

<p>Wellington played off a similar piece of bluff on Marmont
at Fuente Guinaldo in September, 1811, when he
drew up in a position strong indeed, but over-great for the
numbers that he had in hand, and seemed to offer battle.
He was aware that his own reputation for caution was so
great that, if the enemy saw him halt and take up his ground,
they would judge that he had concentrated his whole force,
and would not attack him till their own reserves were near.
He absconded unmolested in the night, while Marmont’s
rear columns were toiling up for the expected battle of the
next day.</p>

<p>For a long time in 1809–10 Wellesley had to assume a defensive
attitude. It was not till 1811 that it at last became
possible for him to think of taking the offensive, nor was
it till 1812, the glorious year of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz,
and Salamanca, that the dream reached its realization.
Hence came it that for a long time he was regarded only as
a cautious and calculating general, a master of defensive
warfare. This conception of him was wrong; as events
showed, in 1812–1813, that he could be a very thunderbolt
of war, when propitious chance gave him the opportunity,
could strike the boldest blows, and launch his army upon
the enemy with the most ruthless energy. But, in the
earlier years of his command, he was always hopelessly
outnumbered, and forced to parry rather than to strike.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
He had to run no risks with his precious little army, the
30,000 British troops on whom the whole defence of the
Peninsula really depended: because if it were destroyed it
could not be replaced. With these 30,000 men he had
covenanted, in his agreement with Castlereagh, when first
he sailed to take command at Lisbon, that he would keep
up the war indefinitely. If by taking some great risk he
had lost 15,000 or even 10,000 men, the government would
have called him home, and would have given up the struggle.
Thus he had to fight with the consciousness that a single
disaster might ruin not only his own plans, but the whole
cause of the allies in Spain. No wonder that his actions
seem cautious! Yet even in 1810–1811 he took some
serious risks, such as the offering of battle at Bussaco and
Fuentes de Oñoro. When even a partial defeat would
mean his own recall, and the evacuation of Portugal, it
required no small resolution even to face such chances as
these. But his serene and equable temper could draw the
exact line between legitimate and over-rash enterprise,
and never betrayed him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington on the Offensive</div>

<p>All the more striking, therefore, was the sudden development
into a bold offensive policy which marked the
commencement of that year of victories 1812. The chance
had at last come: Napoleon was ceasing to pour reinforcements
into Spain—the Russian War was beginning to
loom near at hand. The French no longer possessed their
former overwhelming superiority: in order to hold in check
Wellington’s army, now at last increased by troops from
home to 40,000 British sabres and bayonets, they had to
concentrate from every quarter, and risk their hold on many
provinces in order to collect a force so large that the British
general could not dare to face it. At last, in the winter of
1811–1812, Napoleon himself intervened as Wellington’s
helper, by dispersing his armies too broadcast. The actually
fatal move was the sending of 15,000 of Marmont’s “Army
of Portugal,” the immediate adversary of the Anglo-Portuguese
host, for a distant expedition to the coast of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
Mediterranean in aid of Marshal Suchet. It was the absence
of this great detachment, which could not return for many
weeks, that emboldened Wellington to make his first great
offensive stroke, the storming of Ciudad Rodrigo on January
19, 1812, after a siege of only twelve days.</p>

<p>Following on this first success came the dear-bought
but decisive success of the storming of Badajoz on April 7;
this was a costly business, because Wellington had to operate
“against time,” since, if he lingered over-long, the French
armies from north and south would combine, outnumber
him, and drive him back into Portugal. Badajoz had to
be stormed by sheer force, before all the arts of the engineer
and artillerist had worked their full effect. The fire of the
besieged had not been subdued, nor had the approaches of
the assailants been pushed close up to the walls, as science
would have dictated. But by making three simultaneous
attacks on different points of the fortress, and succeeding
at two of them, Wellington achieved his object and solved
his “time problem.” He showed here, for the first time,
that he could, if it was necessary, spend the lives of his
men remorselessly, in order to finish in a few days a task
which, if much longer delayed, would have had to be abandoned.
This was to his French enemies a revelation of
a new side of his character. He had been esteemed one
who refused risks and would not accept losses. If they had
known of the details of his old Indian victory of Assaye,
they would have judged his character more truly.</p>

<p>But Salamanca was the real revelation of Wellington’s
full powers. It was a lightning stroke, a sudden offensive
movement made at a crisis of momentary opportunity,
which would have ceased if the hour had not been
seized with all promptitude. Wellington hurled his army
unexpectedly at the enemy, who was manœuvring in full
confidence and tranquillity in front of his line, thinking that
he had to deal with an adversary who might accept a battle
(as at Vimeiro, Talavera, or Bussaco), but might be trusted
not to force one on. Salamanca surprised and dismayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
the more sagacious of the French officers. Foy, the most
intelligent observer among them, put down in his diary
six days later, “This battle is the most cleverly fought,
the largest in scale, the most important in results, of any
that the English have won in recent times. It brings up
Lord Wellington’s reputation almost to the level of that
of Marlborough. Up to this day we knew his prudence,
his eye for choosing good positions, and the skill with which
he used them. But at Salamanca he has shown himself
a great and able master of manœuvring. He kept his dispositions
hidden nearly the whole day: he allowed us to
develop our movement before he pronounced his own: he
played a close game; he utilized the “oblique order” in
the style of Frederick the Great.... The catastrophe
of the Spanish War has come—for six months we ought to
have seen that it was quite probable.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>This is one of the most striking and handsome compliments
ever paid by a general of a beaten army to the commander
of the victorious adversaries. It is perfectly true,
and it reflects the greatest credit on Foy’s fair-mindedness
and readiness to see facts as they were. The conqueror of
Salamanca was for the future a much more terrifying
enemy than the victor of Bussaco or Talavera had been.
It is one thing to be repulsed—that had often happened to
the French before—another to be suddenly assailed,
scattered, and driven off the field with crushing losses and
in hopeless disorder, as happened to Wellington’s enemies
under the shadow of the Arapiles on July 22, 1812.</p>

<p>Wellington as a great master of the offensive came into
prominence in 1812, and for the rest of the war it is this side
of him which is most frequently visible, though the retreat
from Burgos shows that his prudence was as much alive
as ever. During the few days that preceded that retreat
there was very great temptation to try a hard stroke at
one of the French armies that were converging on the two
halves of his own force. Napoleon would undoubtedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
have made the attempt. But, Wellington, knowing that
his own total numbers were much inferior to those of the
enemy, and that to concentrate in front of either Soult or
Souham would be to take a terrible risk on the other flank,
preferred a concentric retreat towards his base on the
frontier of Portugal, to a battle in the plains of Castille,
where he was far from home and support, and where a
defeat might lead to absolute ruin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Campaigns of 1813–1814</div>

<p>This was the last time that he was outnumbered and
forced back upon his old methods. In 1813, owing to
Napoleon’s drafts from the army of Spain, which were called
off to replace the troops lost in the Moscow campaign, the
allies had at last a superiority in numbers, though that
superiority consisted entirely in Spanish troops of doubtful
solidity. But even these were conditions far more favourable
than Wellington had ever enjoyed before—he knew
how to use his newly joined Spanish divisions in a useful
fashion, without placing them in the more dangerous and
responsible positions. The campaigns of 1813 and 1814
are both essentially offensive in character, though they
contain one or two episodes when Wellington was, for the
moment, on the defensive in his old style, notably the early
part of the battles of the Pyrenees, where, till his reserves
came up, he was fending off Soult by the use of his more
advanced divisions. But the moment that his army was
assembled he struck hard, and chased the enemy over the
frontier, again in the series of operations that begun on the
last day of Sorauren. There was a very similar episode
during the operations that are generally known as the battle
of the Nive, where Wellington had twice to stand for a
movement in position, while one of his wings was assailed
by Soult’s main body. But this was distinctly what we
may call defensive tactical detail, in a campaign that was
essentially offensive on the whole. The main character
of the operations of 1813–14 may be described as the
clearing out of the enemy from a series of positions—generally
heavily fortified—by successful breaking through of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
lines which Soult on each occasion failed to hold. Invariably
the French army was nailed down to the position which it
had taken up, by demonstrations all along its front, while
the decisive blow was given at selected points by a mass
of troops collected for the main stroke.</p>

<span class="subhead">WELLINGTON’S INFANTRY TACTICS—LINE <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">VERSUS</i> COLUMN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Everyone who takes a serious interest in military history
is aware that, in a general way, the victories of Wellington
over his French adversaries were due to a skilful use of the
two-deep line against the massive column, which had become
the usual fighting-formation for a French army acting on
the offensive, during the later years of the great war that
raged from 1792 till 1814. But I am not sure that the
methods and limitations of Wellington’s system are fully
appreciated, and they are well worth explaining. And on
the other hand it would not be true to imagine that all
French fighting, without exception, was conducted in column,
or that blows delivered by the solid masses whose aspect
the English knew so well, were the only ideal of the Napoleonic
generals. It is not sufficient to lay down the general
thesis that Wellington found himself opposed by troops
who invariably worked in column, and that he beat those
troops by the simple expedient of meeting them, front to
front, with other troops who as invariably fought in the
two-deep battle line. The statement is true in a general
way, but needs explanation and modification.</p>

<p>The use of infantry in line was, of course, no invention
of Wellington’s, nor is it a universal panacea for all crises
of war. During the eighteenth century, from Marlborough
to Frederic the Great, all European infantry was normally
fighting in line, three or four deep, and looking for success
in battle to the rapidity and accuracy of its fire, not to the
impetus of advances in heavy masses such as had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
practised by the pikemen of the sixteenth or seventeenth
century, and were to be introduced again by the French
generals of the Revolutionary period. Everyone knows
how the victories of Frederic the Great were in part to be
attributed to the careful fire-drill of his infantry, who, with
their iron ramrods and rapid manual exercise, used to put
in a far larger and more effective discharge of musket-balls
per minute than their adversaries. But both parties were
as a rule fighting in three-deep line, Austrians no less than
Prussians. Armies had a stereotyped array, with infantry
battalions deployed in long lines in the centre, and heavy
masses of cavalry covering the wings. A glance at the
battle-plans of the War of the Austrian Succession, or of
the Seven Years’ War, shows a marvellous similarity in the
general tactical arrangements of the rival hosts, and front-to-front
collisions of long parallel lines were quite common,
though commanders of genius had their own ways of varying
the tactics of the day. Frederic the Great’s famous
“oblique order,” or advance in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">échelon</i>, with the strong
striking-wing brought forward, and the weaker “containing-wing”
held back and refused, is sufficiently well known.
Occasionally he was able to vary it, as at Rossbach and
Leuthen, and to throw the greater part of his troops across
the enemy’s flank at right angles, so as to roll him up in
detail. But these were “uncovenanted mercies” obtained
owing to the abnormal sloth or unskilfulness of the opposing
general. Torgau needs a special word of mention, as
Frederic’s only battle fought of choice in a thoroughly
irregular formation.</p>

<p>There were one or two cases in the old eighteenth-century
wars of engagements won by the piercing of a
hostile centre, such as Marshal Saxe’s victory of Roucoux
(1746), and we may find, in other operations of that great
general, instances of the use of deep masses, battalion deployed
behind battalion, for the attack of a chosen section
of the hostile position, and others where a line of deployed
infantry was flanked or supported by units practically in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
column. But this was exceptional—as exceptional as the
somewhat similar formation of Cumberland’s mass of British
and Hanoverian infantry at Fontenoy, which, though often
described as a column, had originally consisted of three
successive lines of deployed battalions, which were ultimately
constricted into a mass by lateral pressure. Some of Marshal
Broglie’s and Ferdinand of Brunswick’s fights during
the Seven Years’ War were also fought in a looser order of
battle than was normal.</p>

<p>Normally the tactics of the eighteenth century were
directed to the smashing up of one of the enemy’s wings,
either by outflanking it, or by assailing it with very superior
forces, while the rest of the enemy’s army was “contained”
by equal or inferior numbers, according as the assailant
had more or less troops than his enemy. The decisive blow
was very frequently delivered by a superior force of cavalry
concentrated upon the striking wing, which commenced
the action by breaking down the inferior hostile cavalry,
and then turned in upon the flank of the infantry of the
wing which it had assailed. Such a type of battle may
sometimes be found much later, even in the Peninsular War,
where Ocaña was a perfect example of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frederic II. and Marshal Saxe</div>

<p>Speaking roughly, however, the period of set battles
fought by enemies advancing against each other in more
or less parallel lines ended with the outbreak of the war of
the French Revolution. There had been a fierce controversy
in France from 1775 to 1791 between the advocates of the
linear, or Frederician, battle-order—headed by General
Guibert, and the officers who wished to introduce a deeper
formation, which they claimed to have learnt from the
instructions of Marshal Saxe—of whom the chief was General
Menil-Durand. The former school had triumphed just before
the war began, and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Réglement d’Infanterie</i> of 1791
accepted all their views. It was on this drill-book that the
French infantry stood to fight in the following year, when
the war on the Rhine and in Belgium began.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
But the attempt of the first generals of Revolutionary
France to fight on the old linear system was a failure.
The troops of the Republic had been demoralized by the
removal or desertion of the greater proportion of their
commissioned officers, and their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cadres</i> had been hastily
filled with half-trained recruits. At the same time hundreds
of new units, the battalions of volunteers, had been formed
on no old <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cadre</i> at all, but, with officers and men alike little
better than untrained civilians, took the field along with
the reorganized remains of the old royal army. It is hardly
necessary to remark, that these raw armies suffered a series
of disgraceful defeats at the hands of the Austrian and
other allied troops in 1792–93. They were beaten both in
tactics, in manœuvring, and in fire-discipline by the well-drilled
veteran battalions to which they were opposed.</p>

<p>The French Republic, when it came under the control
of the Jacobins, tried to set matters right by accusing its
generals of treason, and arrested and guillotined a considerable
proportion of the unfortunate commanders-in-chief to
whom its armies had been entrusted. But neither this
heroic device, nor the sending to the armies of the well
known “representatives <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en mission</i>” from the National
Assembly, who were to stimulate the energy of the generals,
had satisfactory results. As the representatives were
generally as ignorant of military affairs as they were self-important
and autocratic, they did no more than confuse
and harass the unhappy generals on whom they were
inflicted.</p>

<p>One thing, however, the Jacobin government did accomplish:
it pushed into the field reinforcements in such
myriads that the armies of the allies were hopelessly outnumbered
on every frontier. The first successes of the
Republican armies in the North were won by brute force,
by heaping double and triple numbers upon the enemy.
And the new tactics of the Revolutionary leaders were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
evolved from a consciousness of superiority in this respect,
a determination to swamp troops that manœuvred better
than their own, by hurling preponderant masses upon them,
regardless of the losses that must necessarily be suffered.
For they had inexhaustible reserves behind them, from the
newly-decreed levies <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i>, while the bases of the allies
were far off, and their trained men, when destroyed, could
only be replaced slowly and with difficulty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tactics of the French Revolution</div>

<p>When the generals of the Revolution threw away the old
linear tactics learned in the school of Frederic the Great,
as inapplicable to troops that could not manœuvre with
the same speed and accuracy as their enemies, the improvised
system that succeeded was a brutal and wasteful
one, but had the merit of allowing them to utilize their
superiority of numbers. It is possible that those of them
who reasoned at all upon the topic—and reasoning was not
easy in that strenuous time, when a commander’s head sat
lightly on his shoulders—saw that they were in a manner
utilizing the idea that had been tried in a tentative way
by Maurice de Saxe, and by one or two other generals of
the old wars—the idea that for collision in long line on a
parallel front, partial attacks in heavy masses on designated
points might be substituted. But it is probable that there
was more of improvisation than of deliberate tactical theory
in the manœuvres of even the best of them.</p>

<p>The usual method was to throw at the hostile front a
very thick skirmishing line, which sheathed and concealed
a mass of heavy columns, concentrated upon one or two
critical points of the field. The idea was that the front line
of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleurs</i> would so engage the enemy, and keep him
occupied all along his front, that at the crucial section of
the combat the supporting columns would get up to striking
distance with practically no loss, and could be hurled,
while still intact, upon those points of the hostile array which
it was intended to pierce; they would go through by their
mere impetus and weight, since they were only exposed to
fire for a few minutes, and could endure the loss suffered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
in that time without losing their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">élan</i> or their pace. The
essential part of the system was the enormously thick and
powerful skirmishing line: whole battalions were dispersed
in chains of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleurs</i>, who frankly abandoned any attempt
at ordered movement, took refuge behind cover of all
sorts, and were so numerous that they could always drive
in the weak skirmishing line of the enemy, and get closely
engaged with his whole front. The orderly battalion-volleys
of the Austrian, or other allied troops opposed to
them, did comparatively little harm to these swarms, who
were taking cover as much as possible, and presented no
closed body or solid mark for the musketry fire poured
upon them. It looks as if the proper antidote against
such a swarm-attack would have been local and partial
cavalry charges, by squadrons judiciously inserted in the
hostile line, for nothing could have been more vulnerable
to a sudden cavalry onslaught than a disorderly chain of
light troops. On many occasions in the campaigns of
1792–93 the French infantry had shown itself very helpless
against horsemen who pushed their charge home, not only
in cases where it was caught unprepared, but even when
it had succeeded in forming square with more or less promptitude.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
But this particular remedy against the swarm-attack
does not seem to have been duly employed, and
indeed many parts of Flanders are so cut up by small
enclosures, that the use of cavalry as a universal panacea
might often have proved impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tactics of the French Column</div>

<p>The masses which supported the thick lines of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleurs</i>
were formed either in columns of companies or columns of
“divisions,” <i>i.e.</i> double companies.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> In the former case
the eight companies, each three deep, were drawn up behind
each other. In the latter the front was formed by a
“division,” and the depth was only twelve men. In either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
case none but the two front ranks could use their firearms
properly, and the rest were useless save for the impetus
that they gave the rolling mass. But such a column, when
properly sheathed by the skirmishing line till the last
moment, generally came with a very effective rush against
the allied line opposed to it, which would have been already
engaged with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleurs</i> for some time, and had probably
been much depleted by their fire. It is equally
clear that, without its protective sheath of skirmishers,
such a heavy column would have been a very clumsy
instrument of war, since it combined the minimum of
shooting power with the maximum of vulnerability. But
when so shielded, the columns which attacked in masses at
a decisive spot, leaving the rest of the hostile line “contained”
by an adequate force, had a fair chance of penetrating,
though the process of penetration might during the
last two or three minutes be very costly to the troops
forming the head of the column.</p>

<p>The best early summary of this change in French tactics
which I know occurs in an anonymous English pamphlet
published in 1802, which puts the matter in a nutshell.
“The French army was composed of troops of the line
without order, and of raw and undisciplined volunteers.
They experienced defeats in the beginning, but in the
meantime war was forming both officers and soldiers. In an
open country they took to forming their armies in columns
instead of lines, which they could not preserve without
difficulty. They reduced battles to attacks on certain
points, where brigade succeeded brigade, and fresh troops
supplied the places of those who were driven back, till they
were enabled to force the post, and make the enemy give
way. They were fully aware that they could not give
battle in regular order, and sought to reduce engagements
to important affairs of posts: this plan has succeeded.
They look upon losses as nothing, provided they attain
their end; they set little store by their men, because they
have the certainty of being able to replace them, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
customary superiority of their numbers affords them an
advantage which can only be counterbalanced by great
skill, conduct, and activity.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>After 1794, when the Republican armies had won their
first series of great successes, and had driven their enemies
behind their own frontiers, there is a distinct change in
the tactical conceptions of the French. The troops had improved
immensely in morale and self-confidence: a new race
of generals had appeared, who were neither obsessed by
reminiscences of the system of Frederic the Great, like some
of their predecessors, nor spurred to blind violence and the
brutal expenditure of vast numbers of men like certain others.
The new generals modified the gross and unscientific methods
of the Jacobin armies of 1793–94, which had won victory
indeed, but only by the force of numbers and with reckless
loss of life. There remained as a permanent lesson, however,
from the earlier campaigns two principles—the
avoidance of dispersion and extension, by which armies
“cover everything and protect nothing,” and the necessity
of striking at crucial points rather than delivering “linear”
battles, fought out at equal intensity along the whole front.
In general French tactics became very supple, the units
manœuvring with a freedom which had been unknown to
earlier generations. The system of parting an army into
divisions, now introduced as a regular organization,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> gave
to the whole army a power of independent movement
unknown in the days when a line of battle was considered
a rigid thing, formed of brigades ranged elbow to elbow,
none of which ought to move without the direct orders of
the general-in-chief. A front might be composed of separate
divisions coming on the field by different roads, and each
adopting its own formation, the only necessity being that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
there should be no great gaps left between them. As a
matter of fact this last necessary precaution was by no
means always observed, and there are cases in the middle,
and even the later, years of the Revolutionary War, in which
French generals brought their armies upon the field in such
disconnected bodies, and with such want of co-operation
and good timing, that they were deservedly defeated in
detail.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> Bonaparte himself is liable to this charge for his
order of attack at Marengo, where he committed himself
to a general action before the column of Desaix was near
enough to the field, and as nearly as possible suffered a
crushing reverse for the want of a mass of troops whose
action was absolutely necessary to him. Hoche, Jourdan,
and Moreau (the last especially), all committed similar
mistakes from time to time. But these errors were at least
better than an adhesion to the stereotyped tactics of the
older generation, where formal set orders of battle had
been thought absolutely necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disadvantages of the Column</div>

<p>As a rule we find the French operating in the later years
of the Republic with methods very different from those of
1793, with skill and swiftness, no longer with the mere brute
force of numerical superiority, winning by brilliant
manœuvring rather than by mere bludgeon work. Yet,
oddly enough, there was no formal revision of official
tactics; the <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Reglement d’Infanterie</cite> which had been drawn
up in 1791, whose base was the old three-deep line of
Frederic the Great, had never been disowned, even when
it was for the most part disregarded, in the period when
swarm-attacks of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleurs</i>, supported by monstrous heavy
columns, had become, perforce, the practical method of the
French armies. When that unsatisfactory time passed by,
the same old drill-book continued to be used, and was no
longer so remote from actual practice as it had been. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
the use of the deployed battalion began to come up again,
as the handiness of the troops increased, and their self-reliance
was restored. Only the early Revolutionary War
had left two marks upon French tactics—for hard and
heavy work, such as the forcing of passes, or bridges, or
defiles, or the breaking of a crucial point in the enemy’s line,
the deep column remained habitually employed: while the
old idea of the orderly continuous line of battle was gone
for ever, or almost gone, for (oddly enough) in Napoleon’s
last and least lucky fight, Waterloo, the order of the
imperial host was more like the trim and symmetrical array
of a Frederician army than any French line of battle that
had been seen for many a year. Certainly it would have
pleased the eye of the Prussian king much better than the
apparently irregular, though carefully thought out, plans
of battle on which Jena or Wagram, Borodino or Bautzen
were won.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The “Ordre Mixte”</div>

<p>It would be doing injustice to Napoleon to represent
him as a general whose main tactical method rested solely
on the employment of massive columns for the critical
operation on each battlefield. He was quite aware that
infantry ought to operate by its fire, and that every man
in the rear ranks is a musket wasted. If the Emperor had
any favourite formation it was the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ordre mixte</i>, recommended
by Guibert far back before his own day, in which a certain
combination of the advantages of line and column was
obtained, by drawing up the brigade or regiment with
alternate battalions in line three-deep and in column. This
formation gave a fair amount of frontal fire from the
alternate deployed battalions, while the columns dispersed
among them gave solidity, and immunity from a flank
attack by cavalry, which might otherwise roll up the line.
If, for example, a regiment of three battalions of 900 men
each were drawn up in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ordre mixte</i>, with one deployed
battalion flanked by two battalions in column, it had
about 730 men in the firing line, while if arranged in three
columns, it would only have had about 200 able to use their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
muskets freely. Still, at the best, this formation was
heavy, since all the serried back-ranks of the flanking
battalions had no power to join in the fusillade. For
simple fire-effect it was as inferior to the line as it was
superior to the mere column.</p>

<p>Napoleon, however, was certainly fond of it. From
the crossing of the Tagliamento (1797), when he is first
recorded to have used it, he made very frequent employment
of it. In a dispatch to Soult, sent him just before
Austerlitz, he directed him to use it “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">autant que faire
se pourra</i>.” It is curious, however, to note that the
marshal, less than a week after, having to strike the
decisive blow in that battle, did not, after all, use the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ordre
mixte</i>, but fought in lines of battalions in “columns of
divisions,” as he particularly mentions in his report to
the Emperor.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>But the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ordre mixte</i> was certainly employed again and
again, not only in those parts of the battle where Napoleon
was simply “containing” his enemy, and where he was
merely keeping up the fight and pinning the adversary to
his position, but also on the crucial points, where he was
endeavouring to deal his main blow. We have notes to
the effect that Lannes’ Corps at Jena, Augereau’s at Eylau,
and Victor’s at Friedland, which were all “striking forces,”
not “containing forces,” used this formation. Its supposed
solidity did not always save it from disaster, as was seen
in the second of the cases quoted above, where Augereau’s
whole corps, despite of its battalions in column, was ridden
down by a flank attack of Russian cavalry, charging covered
by a snowstorm.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of Napoleon’s theoretical preference
for the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ordre mixte</i>, and his knowledge that the column was
a costly formation to employ against an enemy whose fire
was not subdued, it is certain that he used it frequently,
not only for the forcing of bridges or defiles (as at Arcola<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
and Ebersberg<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>), but for giving the final blow at a point
where he was determined to break through, and where the
enemy was holding on with tiresome persistence. At
Wagram the flank-guards of Macdonald’s conquering
advance were formed by 13 battalions in solid column, one
behind the other, though its front consisted of eight deployed
battalions. Friant’s division on the right wing also
attacked with three regiments formed “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en colonne serrée par
bataillons</i>.” At Friedland, Ney’s right division (Marchand)
came to the front in a single file of ten battalions one behind
the other, and never got deployed, but attacked in mass
and was checked. In 1812 and 1813 advance in heavy
masses was usual—whole regiments formed in “column of
divisions,” battalion behind battalion,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> with only 200 yards’
distance between regiment and regiment.</p>

<p>Napoleon was quite aware of the disadvantages of such
formations, “même en plaine,” he observed in a celebrated
interview with Foy, “les colonnes n’enfoncent les lignes
qu’autant qu’elles sont appuyées par le feu d’une artillerie
très supérieure, qui prépare l’attaque.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> And his advances
in column were habitually prepared by a crushing artillery
fire on the point which he was about to assail, a fire which
he himself, as an old artillery officer, knew how to direct
with the greatest accuracy and efficiency. It seems that
he relied much more on such preparation by concentrated
batteries for the shielding of his columns, than on sheathing
them by a thick skirmishing line, the old device of the
generals of the Republic. An enemy’s firing line might be
occupied and demoralized by shot and shell, as well as by
a screen of skirmishers. Jena, indeed, seems to be about
the only one of his battles in which a hostile line was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
masked and depleted by a heavy <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleur</i> attack, before
the columns in support charged and routed it. Often
the light infantry seems to have been practically non-existent,
and it was artillery and formed battalions alone
which fought out the engagement. French generals in the
imperial campaigns appear habitually to have used for the
skirmishing line no more than the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Voltigeur</i> company of
each battalion,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> a force making one-ninth of the whole unit
only, till the number of companies was cut down in 1808
from nine to six, when the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Voltigeurs</i> became one-sixth of
the total. We are very far, by 1805 or 1809, from the day
of the great “swarm-attacks” of the early Republic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tactics of Napoleon’s Generals</div>

<p>It was the tactics of the Empire, not those of the Republic,
which Wellington had to face, when he took command of
the allied army in the Peninsula in 1809. He had to take
into consideration an enemy whose methods were essentially
offensive, whose order of infantry fighting was at the best—in
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ordre mixte</i>—rather heavy, and in many cases,
when the column of the battalion or the regiment was used,
exceptionally gross and crowded. He knew that the enemy
would have a far more numerous cavalry than was at his
own disposition, and that it would be used with reckless
boldness—the cavalry stroke in the Napoleonic battle
accompanied, if it did not precede, the infantry stroke.
Moreover, the French army would have a very powerful
and effective artillery, trained to prepare the way for
infantry attacks by the greatest artillerist in the world.
His own proportion of guns to infantry was ridiculously
low: there was not even one battery per division in 1809.</p>

<p>What was there to oppose to this dangerous enemy in
the way of tactical efficiency? Roughly speaking we may
say that the one point of superiority on which Wellesley
counted, and counted rightly, was the superiority of the
English formation for infantry in the two-deep line to
the heavier order of the enemy’s battalions. For this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
formation he was, of course, not responsible himself: he
took it over as an accepted thing, and thought that he
knew how to turn it to the best account.</p>

<p>The effects of the French War on British tactics had
been notable and interesting. The first reflections published
on the new type of war on this side of the Channel
seem to have been mainly inspired by the experience of
the Duke of York’s army in 1793–94, when the thick
chains of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleurs</i>, which formed the protective screen, or
first line, of the Republican armies, had done so much
damage to troops which fought them in the old three-deep
order, adopted from Frederic the Great, without any
sufficient counter-provision of skirmishers. We find early
in the war complaints that the British forces had no adequate
proportion of light troops—that the one light company per
battalion, normally used, was wholly unable to prevent the
French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleur</i> swarm from pressing up to the main line,
and doing it much harm before the real attack was delivered.
Two remedies were proposed—the first was that the proportion
of light companies in a battalion should be increased
from one to two,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> or that in each regiment a certain number
of men should be selected for good marksmanship, and
taught light infantry drill, while still remaining attached
to their companies. Of these proposals the first was never
tried: the second was actually practised by certain colonels,
who trained fifteen or twenty men per company as
skirmishers: they were called “flankers,” and were to go
out along with the light company. The only British battle
where I have found them specially mentioned is Maida,
where their mention illustrates the danger of the system.
Generals wanting more light troops habitually purloined
the light companies of regiments to make “light battalions”;
but not only did they do this, but they sometimes even
stole the “flankers” also from the centre companies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
Stuart had at Maida not only the light companies, but also
the “flankers” of regiments left behind in Sicily, which
had therefore been deprived of every marksman that they
possessed—an execrable device. The system, however, was
only tentative; it soon disappeared; Wellington never
skimmed the centre companies of their good shots, though
he did occasionally create a light battalion of light companies—even
this was exceptional.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British use of Light Troops</div>

<p>But there was a second alternative course open to the
British: instead of developing more skirmishers in each
battalion, they might create new light-infantry corps, or
turn whole units of the line into light troops. For the
former there was good precedent: in the War of the
American Revolution the British generals had of necessity
embodied corps of riflemen, to oppose to the deadly marksmen
from the backwoods who formed the most efficient
part of the American armies. Such were Simcoe’s Rangers,
and the dismounted part of Tarleton’s famous Legion—whose
remainder consisted of veritable mounted infantry—the
first of their sort in the British army, since dragoons
had forgotten their old trade and become cavalry of the
line. But all the Rangers, etc., had been disbanded in
1783, and their use seems to have been forgotten before the
French War began; the system had to begin again <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de novo</i>.
It was not till 1798 that the first British rifle battalion
was created, to wit the 5th Battalion of the 60th Regiment,
or Royal Americans, which was formed as a Jäger unit out
of the remains of many defunct foreign light corps in British
pay: it remained mainly German in composition even
during the Peninsular War. This was the first green-coated
battalion; the second was Coote Manningham’s
“Experimental Rifle Corps,” formed in January, 1800,
and finally taken into the service after some vicissitudes,
as the 95th—a name famous in Peninsular annals, though
now almost obliterated by its new title of the “Rifle
Brigade.” The regiment was enlarged to three battalions
before it came into Wellington’s hands. Later on, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
the number of rifle corps was not increased, yet an addition
was made to the light troops of the British army by turning
certain picked battalions into light infantry. They were
armed with a special musket of light weight, not with a
rifle, and all the companies equally were instructed in
skirmishing work. The first corps so treated was the 90th
or Perthshire Light Infantry, which received the title in
1794. The precedent was not, however, acted on again
till in 1803, the 43rd and 52nd, the famous regiments of the
Peninsular Light Division, were honoured with the same
designation. The last additions during the period of the
Napoleonic wars were the 68th and 85th in 1808, and the
51st and 71st in 1809. Most of these corps had two battalions,
but, even so, the provision of light infantry was not
large for an army which had then nearly 200 battalions
embodied. There were also some foreign corps to be taken
into consideration, which stood on the British muster-rolls,
such as the two Light Battalions of the King’s German
Legion, the Brunswick Oels Jägers, and the Chasseurs
Britanniques, who all four served in the Peninsula. All
these save the last were created after 1803: but at least
during the second period of the great French War, our
armies were not practically destitute of light troops, as they
were in 1793. We shall see that this had no small importance
in Wellington’s tactical devices.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The British Two-deep Line</div>

<p>The other lesson that might possibly have been deduced
from the campaigns of the earlier years of the great war
was the efficacy of columns for striking at the critical
points of an enemy’s line. The continental enemies of
France were affected by what they had seen of this sort of
success, and often copied the formation of their adversaries.
But it is notable that the old and wholesome prejudice of
the British in favour of the line was in no way disturbed
by what had happened of late. The idea that the column
was a clumsy and expensive formation was not shaken,
and the theory that infantry ought to win by the rapidity
and accuracy of its shooting, and that every musket not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
in the firing-line was wasted, continued to prevail. The
reply of the British to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ordre mixte</i> was to reduce the
depth of the deployed battalion from three ranks to two,
because it had been discovered that the fire of the third
rank was difficult, dangerous to those in front, and practically
ineffective. Sir David Dundas’s drill-book of 1788
with its Prussian three ranks, which had been the official
guide of the British infantry of late, was not formally
cancelled at first, but it was practically disregarded, and the
army went back to the two-rank array, which it had
habitually used in the American War, and had abandoned
with regret. Apparently the Duke of York did not altogether
approve this change: he at least once issued a
General Order, to remind colonels that the formation in
three ranks was still officially recognized and ought not to
be forgotten. But the permission given by an order in
1801, that inspecting officers might allow regiments to
appear “even at reviews” in the two ranks, probably
marked the practical end of the Prussian system.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> It had
certainly been disused by many officers long before that
date, and it is certain that in Abercrombie’s Egyptian
campaign the double instead of the triple rank was in general
use.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> British military opinion had decided that fire was
everything, and that the correct answer to the French
columnar attack was to put more men into the firing
line.</p>

<p>A conclusive proof of the efficacy of the double when
opposed to the triple rank was very clearly given at the
half-forgotten Calabrian battle of Maida, three years after
the commencement of the second half of the great French
War. At this fight the French General Reynier had deployed
the whole, or the greater part, of his battalions, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
were not as usual fighting either in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ordre mixte</i> or in battalion
column. The result was very decisive—5000 British infantry
in the thinner formation received the attack of 6000 French
in the heavier, and inflicted on them, purely by superior
fire-efficiency, one of the most crushing defeats on a small
scale that was ever seen, disabling or taking 2000 men,
with a total loss to themselves of only 320.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> It is worth
while remembering that some of the officers who were
afterwards to be Wellington’s trusted lieutenants were
present at Maida, including Cole, Kempt, Oswald, and
Colborne.<a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> This was about the only instance that I know
where English and French came into action both deployed,
and on a more or less parallel front. Usually it was a case
of “column against line.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington’s System</div>

<p>Sir Arthur Wellesley had been nine years absent in
India before he returned to England in 1805, so that he
had to learn the difference between the Republican and the
Imperial armies by new experience. The problem had
long been interesting him. Before he left Calcutta he is
said to have remarked to his confidants that the French
were sweeping everything before them in Europe by the
use of column formations, but that he was convinced that
the column could, and would, be beaten by the line. What
he heard after his return to England evidently confirmed
him in this opinion. A conversation which he had with
Croker, just before he set sail on the expedition which was
to end at Vimeiro, chances to have been preserved in the
latter’s papers, under the date, June 14, 1808. Sitting
silent, lost in reverie for a long time, he was asked by Croker
the subject of his thoughts. “To say the truth,” he replied,
“I am thinking of the French I am going to fight. I have
not seen them since the campaigns in Flanders [1793–94]<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
when they were capital soldiers, and a dozen years of
victory under Bonaparte must have made them better still.
’Tis enough to make one thoughtful. But though they
may overwhelm me, I don’t think that they will outmanœuvre
me. First, because I am not afraid of them,
as every one else seems to be, and secondly, because (if all
I hear about their system is true) I think it a false one
against steady troops. I suspect all the continental armies
are half-beaten before the battle begins. I at least will
not be frightened beforehand.”</p>

<p>Wellesley went out to Portugal, there to try what could
be done with steady troops against the “French system.”
But it would be to convey a false impression of his meaning
if we were to state that he simply went out to beat column
with line—though the essential fact is sufficiently true.
He went out to try his own conception of the proper way
to use the line formation, which had its peculiarities and
its limitations. The chief of these were <span class="locked">that—</span></p>

<p>(1) The line must not be exposed before the moment
of actual conflict: <i>i.e.</i> it must be kept under cover as much
as possible.</p>

<p>(2) That till the critical moment it must be screened
by a line of skirmishers impenetrable to the enemy’s
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleurs.</i></p>

<p>(3) That it must be properly covered on its flanks,
either by the nature of the ground, or by cavalry and
artillery.</p>

<p>When we investigate all his earlier pitched battles, we
shall see that each of these three requisites was as far as
possible secured.</p>

<p>(1) It was necessary for success that the line should be
kept concealed from the enemy’s distant fire of artillery
and infantry as long as possible. Hence we find that one
of the most marked features of Wellesley’s many defensive
battles was that he took up, whenever it was feasible, a
position which would mask his main line, and show nothing
to the enemy but his skirmishers and possibly his artillery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
for the latter having to operate before the infantry fighting
began, and being obliged to take up positions which would
command the ground over which the enemy must advance,
were often visible from the first. At Vimeiro, Wellesley
so concealed his army that Junot, thinking to turn his left
flank, found his turning column itself outflanked by troops
moved under cover behind a skyline. At Bussaco, Masséna,
no mean general, mistook Wellington’s centre for his extreme
right, and found his attacking columns<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> well outflanked
when the attack had been pressed to its issue. At Salamanca
it was much the same; the main part of the British line
was well concealed behind a low ridge of hills, while
Pakenham’s division and its attendant cavalry, the force
which executed the great stroke, were concealed in a wooded
tract, far outside the French marching column that vainly
thought to get round the allied right wing. At Waterloo,
the clearest case of all, the whole of Wellington’s infantry
of the front line was so far drawn back from the edge of
the slope that it was invisible, till the enemy had climbed
to the brow of the plateau on which it was arrayed. Only
the artillery, the skirmishing line, and the troops in the
outlying posts of Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte could
be made out by Napoleon’s eye. Talavera, as I shall
mention below, is the only exception to this general rule in
the Duke’s defensive battles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Advantages of Cover</div>

<p>Wellington’s ideal position was a rising ground with a
long <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">glacis</i> of slope in front, and a plateau or a dip behind
it. The infantry was drawn back from the skyline, and
placed behind the crest, if the hill were saddle-backed, or
some hundreds of yards away from the edge, if it were
flat-topped. There they stood or lay till they were wanted,
secure from artillery fire: they moved forward to their
actual fighting ground only when the fire-combat of
infantry was to begin. Every one will remember Wellington’s
caustic comment on the Prussian order of battle at
Ligny, where Blücher had drawn out his army in a chequered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
array all along the declivity of a descending slope. “Damnably
mauled these fellows will be—every man visible to
the enemy.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Or in more solemn phrase, as he afterwards
consigned it to paper: “I told the Prussian officers, in
the presence of Colonel Hardinge, that according to my
judgment, the exposure of the advanced columns, and
indeed of the army, to cannonade, standing as they did
displayed to the aim of the enemy’s fire, was not prudent.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p>By the end of the Peninsular War, as I have already
had occasion to observe, it had become so well known to
the French that Wellington’s army, ready for a battle,
would be under cover, that he was able, as at Fuente
Guinaldo in 1811, and at Sorauren in 1813, to play off on
them the trick of offering to fight in a half-manned position,
because he knew that they would take it for granted that
the ground invisible to them was held by an adequate
force. There is an interesting testimony to the same
effect in the Waterloo campaign. On the morning before
the battle of Quatre Bras began, General Reille, a veteran
of the Spanish war, remained halted for some time before
a position held by nothing but a single Dutch-Belgian
division, because (as he expressed it), “Ce pourrait bien
être une bataille d’Espagne—les troupes Anglaises se
montreraient quand il en serait temps.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> This was the
lesson taught by many years of Peninsular experience—but
on this occasion it chanced to be singularly ill applied—since
a vigorous push would have shown Reille that there
were as yet no red-coats concealed behind the trees of the
Bois de Bossu.</p>

<p>It was only when absolute necessity compelled, owing
to there being no cover available in some parts of his chosen
position, that Wellington very occasionally left troops in
his battle-front visible to the enemy, and exposed to artillery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
fire from a distance. The best known instance of this
occurred with his centre brigades at Talavera, who were
unmasked perforce, because between the strong hill which
protected his left, and the olive groves which covered his
right, there were many hundred yards of open ground,
without any serviceable dips or undulations to conceal the
line. And this was almost the only battle in which we find
record of his troops having suffered heavily by artillery
fire before the clash of infantry fighting began.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>(2) The second postulate of Wellington’s system was,
as I have remarked above, that the infantry of his battle-line
must be covered by such a powerful screen of skirmishers,
that the enemy’s advanced line of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleurs</i> should never
be able to get near enough to it to cause any real molestation,
and that it should not be seriously engaged before
the French supporting columns came up to deliver the
main attack. His old experience in Flanders in 1794 had
taught him that the line cannot contend at advantage with
a swarm of light troops, who yield when charged, but
return the moment that the charge has stopped and the
line has drawn back to its original position. There were
evil memories of this sort not only from Flanders, but from
the Egyptian Expedition of 1801, when Abercrombie’s less
engaged brigades suffered severely at the battle of Alexandria
from the incessant fire of skirmishers at long range,
to whom no proper opposition was made.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>The device which Wellesley practised was to make sure
that he should always have a skirmishing screen of his own,
so strong that the French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleurs</i> should never be able
to force it in and to get close to the main line. The moment
that he had assumed command in April, 1809, he set to
work to secure this <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">desideratum</i>. His first measure was to
add to every brigade in his army an extra company of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
trained riflemen, to reinforce the three light companies of
the brigade.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> In April, 1809, he broke up the oldest rifle
battalion in the British army, the fifth of the 60th regiment,
and began to distribute a company of it to each of his
brigades, save to those of the King’s German Legion, which
were served by special rifle companies of their own.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> Thus
each of the brigades which fought at Talavera had a special
extra provision of light troops. Furthermore, when the
new Light Division was instituted on the 1st of March, 1810,
each of its two brigades was given a number of companies
of the 95th rifles: and of the other brigades formed in 1810–11
most were provided with an extra light company by means
of taking fractions from the 95th or the newly arrived
Brunswick Oels Jägers, and those which were not, had light-infantry
corps of their own inside them. But this was
not all.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ample Provision of Light Troops</div>

<p>In the summer of 1810, Wellington began the system
of incorporating a Portuguese brigade of five battalions in
each British division. Of these five one was always<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> a
Caçador or light battalion, specially trained for skirmishing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
The old Portuguese army had not included such battalions,
which were all newly raised corps, intended entirely for light
infantry work. There were originally only six of them,
but Wellington ordered a second six to be raised in 1811,
utilizing as the cadre of the 7th, 8th, 9th the old Loyal
Lusitanian Legion, which Sir Robert Wilson had formed
early in the war. As the Portuguese army contained just
twenty-four regiments of the line, in twelve brigades, the
Caçador battalion gave precisely one unit to each brigade,
save that two were incorporated in the Light Division, while
none was left with the two regiments which remained behind
in garrison at Abrantes and at Cadiz respectively.</p>

<p>As the Caçador battalions were essentially light troops,
and used wholly for skirmishing, it resulted that when an
Anglo-Portuguese division of the normal strength of six
British and five Portuguese battalions set itself in battle
array, it sent out a skirmishing line of no less than eight
British and ten Portuguese companies, viz. one each from
the line battalions, two of British rifles, six of Caçadores,
or a total of from 1200 to 1500 men to a total strength of
5000 to 5500. This, as will be obvious, was a very powerful
protective sheath to cover the front of the division. It
was not always required—the French did not invariably
send out a skirmishing line in advance of their main attack:
but when they did, it would always be restrained and kept
off from the main front of the divisional line. If the
enemy wished to push it in, he had to bring up his formed
battalions through his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleurs</i>, and thus only could he
reach the front of battle. The French regiments, whether
formed in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ordre mixte</i> or (as was more common) in column,
had to come to the front, and only so could reach the
hitherto intact British line. It may be noted that the
enemy rarely used for his skirmishing line more than the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voltigeur</i> company of each battalion; as his divisions
averaged ten to twelve battalions<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> and the unit was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
six-company battalion of 600 men or under, with only one
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voltigeur</i> company, a French division would send out 1000
to 1200 skirmishers, a force appreciably less than the light
troops of a British division of approximately equal force.
Hence Wellington never seems to have been seriously
incommoded by the French skirmishers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advantages of the Skirmishing Screen</div>

<p>So considerable was the British screen of light troops
that the French not unfrequently mistook it for a front
line, and speak of their column as piercing or thrusting
back the first line of their opponents, when all that they
had done was to drive in a powerful and obstinate body
of skirmishers bickering in front of the real fighting formation.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
Invariably, we may say, they had to use their
columns to attack the two-deep line while the latter was
still intact, while their own masses had already been under
fire for some time and were no longer fresh.</p>

<p>It will be asked, perhaps, why the marshals and generals
of Napoleon did not deploy their columns before the
moment of contact. Why do we so seldom read of even the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ordre mixte</i> in use—Albuera is the only battle where we
distinctly find it mentioned? The answer to this objection
is, firstly, that they were strongly convinced that the column
was the better striking force to carry a given point, and
that they were normally attacking not the whole British
line but the particular section or sections where they intended
to break through. But, secondly, we may add that they
frequently did attempt to deploy, but always too late,
since they waited till they had driven in the British skirmishing
line, and tried to assume the thinner formation when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
they were already under fire and heavily engaged. It was
not always that the British noted this endeavour—so late
was it begun, so instant was its failure. But there is
evidence that it was tried by Kellermann’s grenadiers at
Vimeiro, by part at least of Leval’s division at Barrosa, by
Merle’s column at Bussaco, when it had already reached the
summit of the Serra, and was closely engaged with Picton’s
troops. At Albuera we have a good description of it from
the British side. When Myers’ fusilier brigade marched
against the flank of the 5th Corps, in the crisis of that battle,
Soult launched against them his reserve, the three regiments
of Werlé, which became at once locked in combat at very
short range with the fusiliers. “During the close action,”
writes a British officer (Blakeney of the 7th), “I saw their
officers endeavouring to deploy their columns, but all to
no purpose. For as soon as the third of a company got
out, they would immediately run back in order to be
covered by the front of their column.” The fact was, that
the effect of the fire of a British regiment far exceeded anything
that the enemy had been wont to cope with when
engaged with continental troops, and was altogether
devastating. Again and again French officers who came
under it for the first time, made the miscalculation of trying
the impossible. Nothing could be more inevitably productive
of confusion and disorder than to attempt deployment
under such a heavy fire. Wherefore many French
commanders never tried it at all, and thought it more safe
to go on to the final shock with their battalions in the usual
“column of divisions,” in which they had begun their
attack. This was little better, and quite as costly in the
end. “Really,” wrote Wellington, in a moment of unwonted
exhilaration, after the combat of Sabugal, “these attacks
in column against our lines are very contemptible.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>
This was after he had viewed from the other bank of the
Coa, “where I could see every movement on both sides,”
the 43rd regiment repulse in succession three attacks by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
French columns which came up against it, one after the
other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity of Flank Cover</div>

<p>(3) We now come to the third postulate of Wellington’s
system—the two-deep fighting line must be covered on its
flanks, either by the ground, or by cavalry and artillery
support, or by infantry prolonging the front beyond the
enemy’s immediate point of action. At Talavera one of
his flanks was covered by a precipitous hill, the other by
thick olive plantations. At Bussaco both the French
attacks were hopelessly outflanked by troops posted on
high and inaccessible ground, and could only be pushed
frontally. At Fuentes de Oñoro the final fighting position
rested on a heavily occupied village at one end, and on
the ravine of the Turon river upon the other. At Salamanca
the 3rd Division, the striking-force which won the battle,
had its line covered on its outer flank by a British and
a Portuguese brigade of cavalry. At Vittoria the whole
French army was enveloped by the concentric and converging
attack of the much longer British line. At Waterloo
flank protection was secured by the advanced post of
Hougoumont and a “refused” right wing at one end of
the position: by the group of fortified farms (Papelotte,
La Haye, etc.), and a mass of cavalry at the other. Wellington,
in short, was very careful of his flanks. Only once
indeed, so far as I remember, did the French get round the
outlying end of his army and cause him trouble. This was
in the first episode of Fuentes de Oñoro, where the 7th
Division, placed some way out, as a flank-guard, suffered
some loss by being taken in rear by French cavalry which
had made a great circuit, and only escaped worse disaster
because two of its battalions, the 51st and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Chasseurs Britanniques</i>,
had time to form front to flank, and adapt themselves
to the situation, and because a few British squadrons
sacrificed themselves in checking, so long as was possible,
the enemy’s superior horse.</p>

<p>There was one universally remembered instance during
the war which demonstrated the terrible risk that the line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
might run if it were not properly protected on the flanks.
At Albuera Colborne’s brigade of the 2nd Division was
thrown into the fight with its flank absolutely bare—there
was no support within half a mile—by the recklessness of
its divisional general, William Stewart. It was caught
unprepared by two regiments of French cavalry, charging
in at an angle, almost on its rear, and three battalions were
literally cut to pieces, with a loss of 1200 men out of 1600
present, and five colours. Wellington would never have
sent it forward without the proper support on its wings,
and it is noteworthy that, later on the same day, Cole took
the 4th Division into action on the same hill, and against
the same enemy, with perfect success, because he had
guarded one flank with a battalion in column, and the other
(the outer and more exposed one) with a battalion in square
and a brigade of cavalry.</p>

<p>These, then, were the necessary postulates required for
the successful use of line against column, and when they
were duly borne in mind, victory was secure with any
reasonable balance in numbers. The essential fact that
lay behind the oft-observed conclusion was simply that the
two-deep line enabled a force to use every musket with
effect, while the “column of divisions” put seven-ninths
of the men forming it in a position where they could not
shoot at all, and even the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ordre mixte</i> praised by Napoleon
placed from seven-twelfths to two-thirds of the rank and
file in the same unhappy condition.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> But Albuera is the
only fight in the war in which there is definite proof that the
enemy fought in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ordre mixte</i> with deployed battalions
and battalions in column ranged alternately in his front.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Usually he came on with his units all in columns of divisions,
and very frequently (as at Bussaco and in certain episodes
at Talavera) he had battalion behind battalion in each
regiment. It was a gross order of fighting, but D’Erlon
invented a worse and a more clumsy formation at Waterloo,
where he sent forward whole divisions with eight or nine
battalions deployed one behind the other, so as to produce
a front of only 200 men and a depth of twenty-four—with
only one man in twelve able to use his musket.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superior Fire of the Line</div>

<p>Clearly, however, the column of divisions (double companies)
was the normal French order, <i>i.e.</i> in a battalion of
600 men in six companies, we should get a front of 66 muskets
and 132 men able to fire, while 468 were in the rear ranks,
able to be shot but not to shoot. If an English battalion
of equal strength lay in front, in its two-deep line, it could
give a discharge of 600 muskets against one of 132, and
this was not all. Its front was nearly five times that of
the French battalion, so that its fire lapped round the
flanks of the advancing mass, demoralizing it because
there was no proper power to reply. Often the British line,
during the moments of fire-combat, somewhat threw
forward its wings in a shallow crescent, and blazed with
three sides of the column at once. This was done by the
43rd and 52nd at Bussaco, with great effect, against the
French brigade, that of Simon, which came up the slope
in front of them, with its leading regiment ranged three
battalions deep, in a most vulnerable array. How could it
be expected that the column would prevail? Effective
against an enemy who allowed himself to be cowed and
beaten by the sight of the formidable advancing mass, it
was helpless against steady troops, who stood their ground
and emptied their muskets, as fast as they could load, into
a mark which it was impossible to miss. This, probably,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
is what Wellington meant when (as mentioned above) he
stated to Croker, ere ever he sailed for Portugal, that “if
all I hear about their system is true, I think it a false one
against steady troops. I suspect all the continental armies
are half-beaten before the battle begins.” That is to say,
the column might win by the terror that its massive weight
and impetus inspired; but if the enemy refused to be
terrorized, he would be able to hold his own, and to inflict
enormous losses on the crowded formation.</p>

<p>It only remains to be said that, with the battalion in
column of divisions as unit, the French had two ways of
drawing up their attacking line. They might either draw
up the battalions of each regiment in a line of columns, or
they might place them one behind the other, making the
whole regiment into a single column. Both methods were
from time to time employed. It was not details of arrangement
like this which made the difference—the essential
weakness was the “column of divisions” which formed the
base of all the array—it was too helpless in fire-contest
against the line.</p>

<p>The physical aspect of the contest between line and
column we have now sufficiently dealt with. What was
the moral aspect? Fortunately we can explain it with
accuracy, because one of the many thousands of French
officers who went through the Peninsular War has left us,
not personal anecdotes or confused impressions like so many
of his fellows, but a real account of the mental state of a
battalion going forward in column to attack the British
line. I make no excuse for quoting in full the paragraphs
of Bugeaud, a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chef de bataillon</i> in 1812—a marshal of African
fame thirty years later—because they give us exactly what
we want to know. It should be premised, however, that
Bugeaud did not serve in the Army of Portugal, nor face
Wellington’s own troops. He served in Suchet’s army,
along the Mediterranean Coast of the Peninsula, and his
personal observations must have been made at Castalla
and other combats in the East. It is to be noted also that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
he gives no account of the clash of skirmishers which so
often took place, and describes his column as going forward
unsheathed to the main clash of battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bugeaud on Column versus Line</div>

<p>“I served seven years in the Peninsula,” he says;
“during that time we sometimes beat the English in
isolated encounters and raids [<i>e.g.</i> Ordal] which as a field
officer detached I was able to prepare and direct. But during
that long period of war, it was my sorrow to see that only
in a very small number of general actions did the British
army fail to get the better of us. We almost invariably
attacked our adversaries, without either taking into account
our own past experience, or bearing in mind that the
tactics which answered well enough when we had only
Spaniards to deal with, almost invariably failed when an
English force was in our front.</p>

<p>“The English generally held good defensive positions,
carefully selected and usually on rising ground, behind the
crest of which they found cover for a good part of their
men. The usual obligatory cannonade would commence
the operation, then, in haste, without duly reconnoitring
the position, without ascertaining whether the ground
afforded any facilities for lateral or turning movements,
we marched straight forward, ‘taking the bull by the
horns.’<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>“When we got to about a thousand yards from the
English line the men would begin to get restless and excited:
they exchanged ideas with one another, their march began
to be somewhat precipitate, and was already growing a
little disorderly. Meanwhile the English, silent and impassive,
with grounded arms, loomed like a long red wall;
their aspect was imposing—it impressed novices not a little.
Soon the distance began to grow shorter: cries of ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive
l’Empereur</i>,’ ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en avant à la baïonnette</i>,’ broke from our mass.
Some men hoisted their shakos on their muskets, the
quick-step became a run: the ranks began to be mixed up:
the men’s agitation became tumultuous, many soldiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
began to fire as they ran. And all the while the red English
line, still silent and motionless, even when we were only
300 yards away, seemed to take no notice of the storm
which was about to beat upon it.</p>

<p>“The contrast was striking. More than one among us
began to reflect that the enemy’s fire, so long reserved,
would be very unpleasant when it did break forth. Our
ardour began to cool: the moral influence (irresistible in
action) of a calm which seems undisturbed as opposed to
disorder which strives to make up by noise what it lacks in
firmness, weighed heavily on our hearts.</p>

<p>“At this moment of painful expectation the English
line would make a quarter-turn—the muskets were going
up to the ‘ready.’ An indefinable sensation nailed to the
spot many of our men, who halted and opened a wavering
fire. The enemy’s return, a volley of simultaneous precision
and deadly effect, crashed in upon us like a thunderbolt.
Decimated by it we reeled together, staggering under
the blow and trying to recover our equilibrium. Then three
formidable <em>Hurrahs</em> termined the long silence of our adversaries.
With the third they were down upon us, pressing
us into a disorderly retreat. But to our great surprise,
they did not pursue their advantage for more than some
hundred yards, and went back with calm to their former
lines, to await another attack. We rarely failed to deliver
it when our reinforcements came up—with the same want
of success and heavier losses.”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Helplessness of the Column</div>

<p>This is the picture that we need to complete our study
of the conflict of column with line. The psychology of the
huddled mass going forward to inevitable defeat could not
be better portrayed. The only thing that is hard for us
to understand is the reason which induced capable men like
Soult, D’Erlon, or Foy to continue to use the columnar
formation all through the dark days of 1813–14, and even
in the final campaign of Waterloo. All honour must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
paid, however, to the rank and file who, with five years
of such experience behind them, were still steadfast and
courageous enough to put up a good fight even in their
last offensive battles in the Pyrenees, as well as in the
defensive actions of Orthez and Toulouse.</p>

<span class="subhead">WELLINGTON’S TACTICS—THE CAVALRY AND ARTILLERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Hitherto we have been confining our outlook on Wellington’s
tactics to his use of infantry. But a few words must
be added as to his methods of handling the other two
arms—cavalry and artillery. There are fortunately one
or two <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">memoranda</i> of his own which enable us to interpret
his views on the use of these arms, which were to him mainly
auxiliary; for the epigram that he was “essentially an
infantry general” is in the main correct, though it needs
some comment and explanation. In the early part of his
Peninsular campaigning he was forced to be an “infantry
general,” since the home government kept him unreasonably
short in the matter of horsemen and guns till the
year 1811 was far spent. Moreover, the ground over which
he had to fight in 1809–10–11 must be considered.</p>

<p>The Iberian Peninsula may from the point of view of
the cavalry tactician be divided into two sets of regions,
in the one of which the mounted arm is all-important,
while in the other it may, almost without exaggeration, be
described as well-nigh negligible as an element of military
strength, being only usable on a small scale, for exploration
and observation, and not being able to be employed effectively
in mass.</p>

<p>To the first-named class of regions, the tracts eminently
suitable for the employment of cavalry, belong the great
plateau of Central Spain, the broad arable plains of Old
Castile and Leon, from Burgos to Ciudad Rodrigo and
from Astorga to Aranda. Here, in a gently undulating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
upland, little enclosed, and mainly laid out in great common-fields,
cavalry has one of the suitable terrains that can be
found for it in Europe—as favourable as Champagne, or
the lowlands of Northern Germany. This is also, almost
to the same extent, the case with the loftier and less cultivated
plateau of New Castile, and with the melancholy
thinly peopled moors of La Mancha and Estremadura,
where the horseman may ride ahead for twenty or thirty
miles without meeting any serious natural obstacle, save
at long intervals the steep cleft of a ravine, dry in summer,
full of a fierce stream in winter. Nor are the great central
uplands the only tracts of Spain where cavalry finds an
admirable field for operations: the central valley of the
Ebro in Aragon, and the whole of the broad plain of
the Guadalquivir in Andalusia, are equally suited for the
employment of the mounted arm, on the largest scale.
Napoleon, therefore, was entirely justified when he attached
a very large proportion of horse to his Army of Spain, and
when he uttered his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dictum</i> that great portions of it must
inevitably be the possession of the general who owned the
larger and the more efficient mass of squadrons.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are large tracts of the Peninsula
where cavalry is almost as useless as in Switzerland or
Calabria. Such are the whole Pyrenean tract on the north,
extending from Catalonia, by Aragon and Navarre, to the
Asturian and Galician lands along the southern shore of
the Bay of Biscay. It will be remembered that, during
the Pyrenean Campaign of 1813, Wellington sent back
very nearly all his cavalry to the plain of the Ebro, while
Soult left his in the plain of the Adour. Sir John Moore’s
small but fine cavalry force was useless to him in the
Corunna retreat, when once Astorga had been passed, and
the Galician mountains entered. He sent it on before
him, with the exception of a squadron or two kept with the
rear-guard. Soult’s more numerous mounted force, in that
same campaign, was only useful in picking up Moore’s
stragglers, and keeping the British continuously on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
march—it was brought to a dead stop every time that the
retreating army showed an infantry rear-guard, and stood
at bay in one of the innumerable Galician defiles.</p>

<p>There is another tract of the Peninsula almost as
unsuited as the Pyrenean and Galician highlands for the
use of cavalry—and that is Portugal, where so much of
Wellington’s earlier campaigning took place. Deducting
some coast plains of comparatively small extent, all Northern
and Central Portugal is mountainous—not for the most
part mountainous on a large scale, with high summits and
broad valleys, but mountainous on a small scale with
rugged hills of 2000 or 3000 feet, between which flow deeply-sunk
torrents in narrow ravines—where roads are all uphill
and downhill and a defile occurs every few miles. It was
the character of this countryside which made Wellington’s
army of 1810–11, with its very small cavalry force—only
seven British and four or five Portuguese regiments—safe
against Masséna’s immensely preponderant number of
squadrons. All through the long retreat from Almeida to
the lines of Torres Vedras the allied army could never be
caught, turned, or molested; the cavalry on both sides was
only employed in petty rear-guard actions, in which the
small force brought the larger to a check in defiles, and
generally gave back only when the invader brought up
infantry to support his attack. For all the good that it
did him, Masséna might have left his 7000 cavalry behind
him when he entered Portugal—a few squadrons for exploration
was all that he needed. Jammed in narrow defiles,
where they were helpless, his mounted men were often
more of an incumbrance than a help to him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when the slopes of the Portuguese
mountains were once left behind, Wellington was forced
to be most cautious, and to restrict his action to favourable
ground (as at Talavera, and Fuentes d’Oñoro) so long as
the enemy was hopelessly superior in his number of squadrons.
It was only after 1811, when his cavalry regiments were
about doubled in numbers, that he could venture down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
into the plains, and deliver great battles in the open like
Salamanca—the first engagement which he ever fought
in the Peninsula where his cavalry was not inferior by a
third or even a half to that of the French.</p>

<p>Beside the Pyrenean regions and Portugal, there are
other districts of the Peninsula where the cavalry arm is
handicapped by the terrain—Catalonia for example, where
the inland is one mass of rugged valleys, the coastland of
the kingdom of Granada, and the great ganglion of mountain
lands where Aragon, Valencia, and New Castile meet. But
as these were tracts where the British army was little
engaged, I pass them over with a mention. But it must
also be remembered that each of the great upland plateaux
of Spain—Leon, New Castile, La Mancha, and Estremadura,
is separated from the others by broad mountain belts,
where the Spanish guerillero bands made their headquarters,
and rendered communication between plain and plain
difficult and perilous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French Cavalry Tactics</div>

<p>In such a country of contrasts, how did the various
combatants use their mounted men during the six long
years between Vimeiro and Toulouse? What was the
relative value of the different national cavalry, and what
were its tactics for battle and for the equally important
work of exploration, and of the covering and concealing
the movements of the other arms?</p>

<p>French cavalry tactics had, by 1808, when the war
began, developed into as definite a system as those of the
infantry. Napoleon was fond of massing his horsemen in
very large bodies, and launching them at the centre no
less than at the flank of the army opposed to him. In the
times of Marlborough and of Frederic the Great cavalry
was almost always drawn up in long lines on the wings,
and used first for the beating of the hostile containing
cavalry, and then for turning against the unprotected flank
of the enemy’s infantry in the centre. A cavalry dash at
a weak point in the middle of the hostile front was very
rare indeed, and only tried by the very few generals of first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
rate intelligence, who had emancipated themselves from
the old routine which prescribed the regular drawing up of
an army. Marlborough’s cavalry charge at the French
right-centre at Blenheim is almost the only first-rate
example of such a stroke in the old wars of the eighteenth
century. Frederic’s great cavalry charge at Rossbach,
which is sometimes quoted as a parallel, was after all no
more than a sudden rush of the Prussian flank-cavalry at
the exposed wing of an army which was unwisely trying to
march around the position of its adversary. But Napoleon
was the exponent of great frontal attacks of cavalry on
chosen weak spots of the enemy’s line, which had already
been well pounded by artillery or weakened in some other
way. He would use 6000, 8000, or (as at Waterloo) even
12,000 men for one of these great strokes. At Austerlitz
and Borodino these charges were made straight at the
enemy’s front: Marengo and Dresden were won by such
rushes: Eylau was only saved from falling into a disaster
by a blow of the same kind. But cavalry had to be used
at precisely the right moment, to be most skilfully led,
and to be pushed home without remorse and despite of all
losses, if it was to be successful. Even then it might be
beaten off by thoroughly cool and unshaken infantry, as
at Waterloo. It was only against exhausted, distracted,
or untrained battalions that it could count with a reasonable
certainty of success.</p>

<p>All through the war the raw and badly-drilled Spanish
armies supplied the French squadrons with exactly this
sort of opportunities. They were always being surprised
before they had been formed by their generals in line of
battle, or caught in confusion while they were executing
some complicated manœuvre. If attacked while they were
in line or in column of march, they always fell victims to a
cavalry charge, being from want of discipline extraordinarily
slow to form square. As if this was not enough, they were
often weak enough in morale to allow themselves to be
broken even when they had time to form their squares.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
The battles of Medellin, Ocaña, the Gebora, and Saguntum,
were good examples of the power of a comparatively small
mass of cavalry skilfully handled, over a numerous but
ill-disciplined infantry. But the little-mentioned combat
of Margalef in 1810 is perhaps the strongest example of the
kind, for there six squadrons of Suchet’s cavalry (the 13th
Cuirassiers supported by two squadrons of the 3rd Hussars)
actually rode down in succession, a whole division of some
4000 men, whom they caught while forming line of battle
from column of march. This was done, too, despite of
the fact that the Spanish infantry was accompanied by three
squadrons of cavalry (who made the usual bolt at the
commencement of the action), as well as by a half-battery
of artillery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Successes of the French Cavalry</div>

<p>It was of course a very different matter when the French
cavalry had to face the steady battalions of the British
army. Looking down all the record of battles and skirmishes
from 1808 down to 1814, I can only remember two
occasions when the enemy’s cavalry really achieved a notable
tactical success. Oddly enough both fell within the month
of May, 1811. At Albuera there occurred that complete
disaster to a British infantry brigade which has already
been described in the preceding chapter. The other, and
much smaller, success achieved by French cavalry over
British infantry at Fuentes de Oñoro, a few days before
the greater disaster at Albuera, has also been alluded to.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
These two disasters were wholly exceptional; usually
the British infantry held its own, unless it was absolutely
taken by surprise, and this even when attacked frontally
by cavalry while it was deployed in the two deep line, without
forming square. If the British had their flanks covered,
they were perfectly safe, and turned back any charge with
ease.</p>

<p>Indeed the repulse of cavalry by British troops in line,
who did not take the trouble to form square because their
flanks were covered, was not infrequent in the Peninsular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
War. The classic instance is that of the 5th Northumberland
Fusiliers at El Bodon in 1811, who advanced in line
firing against two French cavalry regiments and drove
them off the heights, being able to do so because they had
a squadron or two of British horse to protect them from
being turned. A very similar feat was performed by the
52nd at Sabugal in 1811: and Harvey’s Portuguese brigade
did as much at Albuera.</p>

<p>Much more, of course, was the square impregnable.
When once safely placed in that formation, British troops
habitually not only withstood cavalry charges at a stand-still,
but made long movements over a battlefield inundated
by the hostile cavalry. At Fuentes de Oñoro the
Light Division, three British and two Portuguese squares,
retreated at leisure for <em>two miles</em> while beset by four brigades
of French cavalry, and reached the ground which they had
been ordered to take up with a total loss of one killed and
thirty-four wounded. Similarly at El Bodon the square
composed of the 5th and 77th retreated for six miles, in the
face of two cavalry brigades which could never break
into them.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>Indeed it may be stated, as a rule almost without
exception, that troops in square, whether British or French,
were never broken during the Peninsular War even by
very desperate and gallant charges. One of the best
instances of this general rule was the case of the combat of
Barquilla, where two grenadier companies of the French
22nd, surprised while covering a foraging party by five
squadrons of British cavalry, got away in a level country
after having been charged successively by three squadrons
of the 1st Hussars of the German Legion, the 16th and the
14th Light Dragoons. One of these three squadron-charges,
at least (that of the 14th), had been pushed home so handsomely
that an officer and nine men fell actually among
the French front rank, and a French observer noted bayonets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
broken, and musket barrels deeply cut into by the sweeping
blows of the light dragoons, who yet failed entirely to
break in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cavalry Action against Squares</div>

<p>There was indeed only one extraordinary case of properly
formed squares being broken during the whole war, a case
as exceptional in one way as the disaster to Colborne’s
brigade at Albuera was in the other. This was at the
combat of Garcia Hernandez, on the morning after the
battle of Salamanca, where the heavy dragoons of the
K.G.L. delivered what Foy (the French historian of
the war) called the best charge that he had ever seen. The
rear-guard of Marmont’s army had been formed of the one
division which had not been seriously engaged in the
battle, so that it could not be said to have been composed
of shaken or demoralized troops. Nevertheless, two of its
squares were actually broken by the legionary dragoons,
though drawn up without haste or hurry on a hillside
favourable for defensive action. According to Beamish’s
<cite>History of the German Legion</cite>, a work composed a few years
later from the testimony of eye-witnesses, the first square
was broken by a mortally wounded horse, carrying a dead
rider, leaping right upon the kneeling front rank of the
square, and bearing down half a dozen men by its struggles
and kicking. An officer, Captain Gleichen, spurred his
horse into the gap thus created, his men followed, a wedge
was thrust into the square, and it broke up, the large
majority of the men surrendering. The second square,
belonging to the same regiment, the 6th Léger, was a little
higher up the hillside than the first: it was a witness of
the destruction of the sister-battalion, and seems to have
been shaken by the sight: at any rate, when assailed a
few minutes later by another squadron of the German
Dragoons, it gave a rather wild though destructive volley,
and wavered at the moment of receiving the attack, bulging
in at the first charge. This was, of course, fatal. The
broken squares lost 1400 prisoners, beside some 200 killed
and wounded. The victorious dragoons paid a fairly high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
price for their success, losing 4 officers and 50 men killed,
and 2 officers, and 60 men wounded out of 700 present; the
extraordinary proportion of killed to wounded, 54 to 62
marking the deadly effect of musketry at the closest possible
quarters.</p>

<p>This (as I said before) was the exception that proved
the rule: the invulnerability of a steady square was such
a commonplace, that Foy and the other old officers of the
Army of Spain, looked with dismay upon Napoleon’s great
attempt at Waterloo to break down the long line of British
squares between La Haye Sainte and Hougoumont, by the
charges of some ten or twelve thousand cavalry massed on
a short front of less than a mile. The Emperor had not
allowed for the superior resisting power of a thoroughly
good infantry.</p>

<p>Of fights between cavalry and cavalry, when the two
sides were present in numbers so fairly equal as to make the
struggle a fair test of their relative efficiency, there were
comparatively few in the Peninsular War. In the early
days of the war Wellington was too scantily provided with
horsemen, and could never afford to engage in a cavalry
battle on a large scale. He had only six regiments at
Talavera in 1809, only seven in the Bussaco campaign of
1810. When he divided his army for the simultaneous
campaign in Beira and in Estremadura in March, 1811, he
could only give Beresford three regiments, and keep four
for himself. Nor could the deficiency be supplied (as was
done in the artillery arm) by using Portuguese auxiliaries.
The cavalry of that nation was so weak and so badly
mounted that it is doubtful whether there were ever so
many as 2000 of them in the field at once. Many of the
twelve regiments were never mounted, and did garrison
duty as infantry throughout the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington and his Cavalry</div>

<p>It was not till the summer and autumn of 1811 that
Wellington at last began to get large reinforcements of the
mounted arm from England, which more than doubled his
strength, for in the campaign of 1812 he had no less than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
fifteen regiments instead of seven. In the winter of 1812–13
further reinforcements came out, and in the Vittoria campaign
he had at last a powerful cavalry equal or superior
to that of the French.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p>Yet even allowing for the weakness of Wellington’s
mounted strength in his earlier campaigns, we must acknowledge
that they played a comparatively small part in his
scheme of operations. Though his dragoons did good
service in keeping his front covered, and performed many
gallant exploits (we need only mention Talavera and
Fuentes de Oñoro to instance good self-sacrificing work
done), they were seldom used as part of the main striking
force that won a victory. Indeed, the charge of Le Marchant’s
heavy brigade at Salamanca is about the only
instance that can be cited of really decisive action by cavalry
in any of the Duke’s battles. There were other notable
successes to be remembered, but they were in side issues,
and often not under the chief’s own eye—as, for example,
Bock’s breaking of the squares at Garcia Hernandez on the
day after Salamanca, and Lumley’s very creditable victory
over Latour-Maubourg at Usagre on May 25, 1811.</p>

<p>Even when Wellington had at last a large cavalry force
in 1812–14, it was seldom found massed, and I believe that
more than three brigades were never found acting together.
Such a force as six regiments was seldom seen in line and
engaged. For the use of cavalry as a screen we may
mention the combat of Venta del Pozo, during the retreat
from Burgos in 1812. This was a skirmish fought by two
brigades to cover the withdrawal of the infantry, which
had to hurry hard on the way toward Salamanca and
safety.</p>

<p>Something, no doubt, must be allowed for the fact that
Wellington never, till the Waterloo campaign, had an
officer of proved ability in chief command of his cavalry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
Stapleton Cotton, who served so long in that capacity, was
not a man of mark. Lumley, who had a short but distinguished
career as a divisional commander, went home
sick in 1811, and Le Marchant, who came out from home
with a high reputation, was most unfortunately killed in
his first battle, Salamanca, where his brigade did so much
to settle the fortunes of the day. But allowing for all
this, it remains clear that Wellington made comparatively
little use of the cavalry arm—which could hardly have been
expected when we remember how effectively he had used
his horse at Assaye, quite early in his career. Possibly the
fact that he was so hopelessly outmatched in this arm in
1809–11 sunk so much into his soul, that when he got his
chance, later on, he was not ready to use it. Certainly several
cases can be cited where it was not duly used to press a completed
victory—most particularly after Vittoria and Orthez.
There is no concealing the fact that Wellington’s reluctance
to use great cavalry attacks was, at bottom, due to his
doubts as to the tactical skill of his senior officers, and the
power of his regiments to manœuvre. He divulged his
views on the subject, twelve years after the war was over,
in a letter to Lord John Russell, dated July 31, 1826. “I
considered our cavalry,” he wrote, “so inferior to the
French from want of order, that although I considered one
of our squadrons a match for two French, yet I did not
care to see four British opposed to four French, and still
more so as the numbers increased, and order (of course)
became more necessary. They could gallop, but could not
preserve their order.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some Reckless Cavalry Charges</div>

<p>This seems a very hard judgment, when we examine
in detail the cavalry annals of the Peninsular War. There
were cases, no doubt, where English regiments threw
away their chances by their blind fury in charging, and
either got cut up from pursuing an original advantage to
a reckless length, or at any rate missed an opportunity by
over-great dispersion or riding off the field. The earliest
case was seen at Vimeiro just after Wellington’s first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
landing in the Peninsula, when two squadrons of the 20th
Light Dragoons, after successfully cutting up a beaten
column of infantry, pushed on for half a mile in great disorder,
to charge Junot’s cavalry reserves, and were horribly
maltreated—losing about one man in four. An equally
irrational exploit took place at Talavera, where the 23rd
Light Dragoons, beaten off in a charge against a square
which they had been ordered to attack, rushed on beyond
it, against three successive lines of French cavalry, pierced
the first, were stopped by the second, and had to cut their
way back with a loss of 105 prisoners and 102 killed and
wounded—nearly half their strength. An equally headlong
business was the charge of the 13th Light Dragoons at
Campo Mayor on March 25, 1811, when that regiment, having
beaten in fair fight the French 26th Dragoons, and captured
eighteen siege-guns which were retreating on the road,
galloped on for more than six miles, sabring the scattered
fugitives, till they were actually brought up by the fire of
the fortress of Badajoz, on to whose very glacis they had
made their way. The captured guns, meanwhile, were
picked up by the French infantry who had been retreating
along the high-road behind their routed cavalry, and
brought off in safety—the 13th not having left a single
man to secure them. Here, at any rate, not much loss was
suffered, though a great capture was missed, but similar
galloping tactics on June 11, 1812, at the combat of Maguilla,
led to a complete disaster. Slade’s heavy brigade (1st
Royals and 3rd Dragoon Guards) fell in with L’Allemand’s
French brigade, the 17th and 27th Dragoons. Each drew
up, but L’Allemand had placed one squadron in reserve far
beyond the sky line, and out of sight. Slade charged, beat
the five squadrons immediately opposed to him, and then
(without reforming or setting aside any supports) galloped
after the broken French brigade in complete disorder for
a mile, till he came parallel to the unperceived reserve
squadron, which charged him in flank and rear: the rest
of the French halted and turned; Slade could not stand, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
was routed, having 40 casualties and 118 prisoners. Wellington
wrote about this to Hill: “I have never been more
annoyed than by Slade’s affair. Our officers of cavalry
have acquired a trick of galloping at everything. They
never consider the situation, never think of manœuvring
before an enemy, and never keep back or provide for a
reserve. All cavalry should charge in two lines, and at
least one-third should be ordered beforehand to pull up and
reform, as soon as the charge has been delivered, and the
enemy been broken.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>In the first three of the cases mentioned above, the
discredit of the rash and inconsiderate pressing on of the
charge falls on the regimental officers—in the last on
the brigadier, Slade. It must be confessed that Wellington
was not very happy in his senior cavalry officers—Erskine,
Long, and Slade have all some bad marks against them—especially
the last-named, whose proceedings seem nearly
to have broken the heart of the lively and intelligent
diarist Tomkinson, of the 16th Light Dragoons, who had the
misfortune to serve long under him. Stapleton Cotton, the
commander of the whole cavalry, was but a mediocrity;
every one will remember his old chief’s uncomplimentary
remarks about him <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">àpropos</i> of the siege of Bhurtpore. The
man who ought to have been in charge of the British horse
during the whole war was Lord Paget, who had handled
Sir John Moore’s five cavalry regiments with such admirable
skill and daring during the Corunna campaign: his two
little fights of Sahagun and Benevente were models in
their way. But he was unhappily never employed again
till Waterloo—where his doings, under his new name of
Lord Uxbridge, are sufficiently well known. But a question
of seniority, and an unhappy family quarrel with the
Wellesleys (having absconded with the wife of Wellington’s
brother Henry, he fought a duel with her brother in consequence)
prevented him from seeing service under the Duke in
the eventful years 1809–14. Of the cavalry generals who took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
part in the great campaigns, after Paget the most successful
was Lumley, who has two very fine achievements to his
credit—the containing of Soult’s superior cavalry during
the crisis of the battle of Albuera, and the combat of Usagre,
of May 25, 1811, noted above. This was considered such an
admirable piece of work by the enemy, that it is related at
great length in Picard’s <cite xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Histoire de la Cavalerie</cite>, alone
among all British successes of the Peninsular War.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lumley’s Victory at Usagre</div>

<p>It needs a word of notice, as it is hardly mentioned in the
Wellington dispatches, and very briefly by Napier. Latour-Maubourg
had been sent by Soult to push back Beresford’s
advanced posts, and discover his position. He had a very
large force—two brigades of dragoons and four regiments
of light cavalry, in all 3500 sabres. Lumley, who was
screening Beresford’s movements, had only three British
regiments (3rd Dragoon Guards, 4th Dragoons, 13th Light
Dragoons), 980 sabres, and Madden’s and Otway’s Portuguese
brigades, 1000 sabres, with 300 of Penne Villemur’s Spanish
horse. Wishing to contain the French advance as long as
possible, he took up a position behind the bridge and village
of Usagre, a defile through which the French must pass in
order to reach him. Latour-Maubourg, relying on the
immense superiority of numbers which he possessed, was
reckless in his tactics. After sending off a brigade of light
horse to turn Lumley’s position, by a very long detour and
distant fords, he pushed his other three brigades into the
village, with orders to cross the bridge and press the enemy
in front. Lumley was showing nothing but a line of
Portuguese vedettes, having withdrawn his squadrons
behind the sky line. He was apprised of the turning
movement, but, knowing the ground better than the
French, was aware that it would take a very much longer
time than the enemy expected, so resolved to hold his
position to the last moment. He allowed the two leading
regiments of Bron’s dragoons to pass the bridge and form
on the nearer side, and then, while the third regiment was
crossing the river, and the second brigade was entering the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
long village, charged suddenly in upon the first brigade,
with six English squadrons in front and six Portuguese
squadrons on the right flank. The two deployed French
regiments were thrown back on the third, which was jammed
on the bridge. Hence they could not get away to reform and
rally, the road behind them being entirely blocked, while
the second brigade in the village could not get to the front
to give assistance. All that Latour-Maubourg could do
was to dismount its leading regiment and occupy with it the
houses on each side of the bridge, from which they kept
back the victorious British by their carbine fire. Lumley,
meanwhile, dealt with the three routed regiments at his
leisure, killing or wounding 250 men and capturing 80
prisoners before the disordered wrecks succeeded in re-crossing
the river. Latour-Maubourg, warned by this bloody
check, showed for the future no anxiety to press in upon
Beresford’s cavalry screen.</p>

<p>How <em>not</em> to deal with an exactly similar situation, it
may be remarked, was shown on the 23rd October of the
following year, 1812, by two British brigadiers, who, charged
with the covering of the retreat of Wellington’s army from
Burgos, were holding a position behind the bridge of Venta
del Pozo or Villadrigo, when the part of the French cavalry
immediately opposed to them, the brigade of Faverot, ten
squadrons strong, came down to the defile. Faverot, like
Latour-Maubourg at Usagre, took the hazardous step of
ordering his leading regiment to pass the bridge at a trot,
and form on the other side. This Bock, the senior British
brigadier, allowed it to do, and was right in so doing, for
the proper moment to strike was when the enemy should
have half or three-quarters of his men across the bridge,
and the rest jammed upon it. But Bock allowed the psychological
moment to pass, and did not charge till the French
brigade had almost entirely crossed, and could put very
nearly equal numbers in line against him. Then, moving
too late, with some squadrons of Anson’s brigade in support,
he came to a desperate standing fight with the enemy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
in which both suffered very heavily. But when all the
British and German Legion regiments were already engaged,
the rearmost squadrons of the French, which had crossed
the bridge under cover of the fighting line, fell upon Bock
from the flank, and turned one of his wings; the British
cavalry had to give way and retreat, till it was covered by
the infantry of the 7th Division. If Bock had charged
five minutes earlier, he would have nipped the French
column in the middle, and probably have destroyed the
leading regiments. The French brigade, as it was, lost
18 officers and 116 men, Anson and Bock about 200, among
whom were four officers and 70 men prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Surprise of Arroyo Dos Molinos</div>

<p>On the whole, I am inclined to think that Wellington
was a little hard on his cavalry. There was, of course, considerable
justification for his criticisms. There was a want
of decision and intelligence among some of his brigadiers,
and a tendency to headlong and reckless charging straight
ahead among many of his regimental officers. But looking
dispassionately at the cavalry work on both sides, it is impossible
to say that the French marshals were any better
served. There is no striking instance in the annals of the
British campaigns of 1809–14 of the army, or even a division,
being surprised for want of vigilance on the part of its
cavalry screen, while several such can be quoted on the
French side—especially Ney’s surprise at Foz d’Arouce on
March 15, 1811—caused by his light cavalry under Lamotte
having completely failed to watch the roads, or the better-known
rout of Girard at Arroyo dos Molinos later in the
same year. On that occasion an infantry division, accompanied
by no less than two brigades of light cavalry, was
attacked at dawn and dispersed with heavy loss, owing to
the fact that the cavalry brigadiers, Bron and Briche, had
taken no precautions whatever to feel for the enemy. They,
like the infantry, were completely surprised, being caught
with the horses unsaddled, and the men dispersed among
houses; hence the chasseurs were taken prisoners in large
numbers by Hill’s sudden rush, one of the brigadiers and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
cavalry colonel being among the 2000 unwounded prisoners
taken. There is no such large-scale surprise as this among
all the records of the British cavalry. The worst that I
know were those of a squadron of the 13th Light Dragoons
on April 6, 1811, near Elvas, and a very similar one of the
11th Light Dragoons two months later, not far from the
same place. In the last case the disaster is said to have
happened because the regiment had only just landed from
England after long home-service, and the captain in
command lost his head from sheer inexperience. With
regard to this I may quote the following pregnant sentence,
from the <cite>Diary</cite> of Tomkinson, who wrote far the best
detailed account of the life of a cavalry regiment during
those eventful years. “To attempt giving men or officers
any idea in England of outpost duty was considered absurd,
and when they came abroad they had all to learn. The
fact was that there was no one to teach them. Sir Stapleton
Cotton (who afterwards commanded the cavalry in Spain)
once tried an experiment with the 14th and 16th Light
Dragoons near Woodbridge in Suffolk. In the end he got
the supposed enemy’s vedettes and his own all facing the
same way. In England I never saw nor heard of cavalry
taught to charge, disperse, and reform, which of all things,
before an enemy, is most essential. Inclining in line right
or left is very useful, and that was scarcely ever practised.”
He adds in 1819: “On return to English duty, after the
peace, we all continued the old system, each regiment
estimating its merit by mere celerity of movement. Not
one idea suggested by our war experience was remembered,
and after five years we shall have to commence all over
again, if we are sent abroad.”</p>

<p>In short, the proper work of cavalry, apart from mere
charging, had to be learnt on Spanish soil when any regiment
landed. But it was in the end picked up by the better
corps, and on the whole the outpost and reconnaissance work
of the Peninsular Army seem to have been well done, though
some regiments had a better reputation than others. Much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
of the work of this kind speaks for itself. The most admirable
achievement during the war was undoubtedly that of
the 1st Hussars of the K.G.L., who, assisted afterwards by
the 14th and 16th Light Dragoons, kept for four months
(March to May, 1810) the line of the Agueda and Azava,
40 miles long, against a fourfold strength of French cavalry,
without once letting a hostile reconnaissance through,
losing a picket or even a vedette, or sending a piece of false
information back to General Craufurd, whose front they
were covering.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington’s Cavalry Tactics</div>

<p>Allusion has been made in the opening words of this
chapter to Wellington’s memorandum for the tactical
management of cavalry. It was only issued after Waterloo,
in the form of “Instructions to Officers commanding Brigades
of Cavalry in the Army of Occupation,” but, no doubt,
represents the tactics which he had evolved from his
Peninsular experience.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> Too long to give in entirety, it is
worth analysing. The heads run as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p>(1) A reserve must always be kept, to improve a success,
or to cover an unsuccessful charge. This reserve should
not be less than half the total number of sabres, and may
occasionally be as much as two-thirds of it.</p>

<p>(2) Normally a cavalry force should form in three
lines: the first and second lines should be deployed, the
reserve may be in column, but so formed as to be easily
changed into line.</p>

<p>(3) The second line should be 400 or 500 yards from the
first, the reserve a similar distance from the second line, if
cavalry is about to act against cavalry. This is found not
too great a distance to prevent the rear lines from improving
an advantage gained by the front line, nor too little to
prevent a defeated front line from passing between the
intervals of its supports without disordering them.</p>

<p>(4) When, however, cavalry is charging infantry, the
second line should be only 200 yards behind the first, the
object being that it should be able to deliver its charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
without delay, against a battalion which has spent its
fire against the first line, and will not be prepared for a
second charge pushed in rapid succession to the first.</p>

<p>(5) When the first line delivers its attack at a gallop, the
supports must follow at a walk only, lest they be carried
forward by the rush, and get mingled with the line in
front at the onset. For order in the supports must be
rigidly kept—they are useless if they have got into confusion,
when they are wanted to sustain and cover a checked
first line.</p>

<p>A note as to horses may finish our observations on the
cavalry side of Wellington’s tactics. In countless places,
in diaries no less than dispatches, we find the complaint
that the trooper of 1810 was, when not well looked after by
his officers, a bad horse-master—careless as to feeding his
mount, and still more so as to saddle-galls and such like.
It is often remarked that the one German light cavalry
regiment in the original Peninsular Army, the 1st Hussars
of the King’s German Legion, set an example which some
other regiments might have copied with advantage, being
far more conscientious and considerate to their beasts. It
is interesting to find that the French cavalry reports have
exactly the same complaints, and the number of dismounted
men shown in French regimental states as a consequence of
sick horses was as great as our own. Several times I have
found the report that when a considerable number of French
cavalry had been captured, quite a small proportion of
their horses could be turned over to serve as remounts for
their captors, because of the abominable condition in which
they were found. The fact was that the climate and the
food seem to have been equally deleterious to the English
and French horses: a diet of chopped straw and green
maize—often all that could be got—was deadly to horses
accustomed to stable diet in England or France. Wellington
sometimes actually imported hay and oats from
England; but they could not be got far up country, and
only served for regiments that chanced to be put into winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
quarters near the sea. Practically all the remounts came
from England—the Portuguese and Spanish horses having
been tried and found wanting many times. In 1808 the
20th Light Dragoons were embarked without horses, being
ordered to mount themselves in Portugal; but the experiment
failed wholly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington’s Artillery Tactics</div>

<p>Only a short note is required as to Wellington’s use of
artillery. In his early years of command he was almost as
weak in this arm as in cavalry. There was not one British
battery per division available in 1809. But the Portuguese
artillery being numerous, and ere long very efficient, was
largely used to supplement the British after 1810. Yet
even when it had become proportioned to the number of his
whole army, the Duke did not use it in the style of Bonaparte.
He never worked with enormous masses of guns manœuvring
in front line, and supporting an attack, such as the
Emperor used. Only at Bussaco, Vittoria, and Waterloo
do we find anything like a concentration of many batteries
to play an important part in the line of battle. Usually the
Duke preferred to work with small units—individual
batteries—placed in well-chosen spots, and often kept
concealed till the critical moment. They were dotted
along the front of the position rather than massed, and in
most cases must be regarded as valuable support for the
infantry that was to win the battle, rather than as an arm
intended to work for its independent aims and to take a
special part in war. Of several of Napoleon’s victories we
may say that they were artilleryman’s battles; nothing of
the kind can be predicated of any of Wellington’s triumphs,
though the guns were always well placed, and most usefully
employed, as witness Bussaco, Fuentes de Oñoro, and
Waterloo.</p>

<p>As to Wellington’s use of siege artillery, we must speak
in a later chapter.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> It was, through no fault of his own,
the weakest point in his army: indeed till 1811 he never
had a British battering-train, and in the early sieges of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Badajoz he worked <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in forma pauperis</i>, with improvised
material, mainly Portuguese, and very deficient in quality.
The record is not a cheerful one; but it must be said that
the home authorities, and not Wellington, were the responsible
parties for any checks that were suffered. A great
general who is not an artillery or engineering specialist
must trust to his scientific officers, and certainly cannot be
made responsible for shortage of men and material due to
the parsimony of his masters at home.</p>

<p>So much for the great Duke’s tactics. We shall presently
be investigating his system of military organization—the
inner machinery of his army. But before dealing with it,
we shall have to spare some attention for his greater
lieutenants, whose individualities had an important share
in the management of his army.</p>

<span class="subhead">WELLINGTON’S LIEUTENANTS—HILL, BERESFORD,
GRAHAM</span></h2>
</div>

<p>There can be no stronger contrast than that between the
impression which the Iron Duke left on his old followers,
and that produced by his trusted and most responsible
lieutenant, Sir Rowland Hill. Hill was blessed and kindly
remembered wherever he went. He was a man brimming
over with the milk of human kindness, and the mention
of him in any diary is generally accompanied by some
anecdote of an act of thoughtful consideration, some
friendly word, or piece of unpremeditated, often homely
charity. A wounded officer from Albuera, who is dragging
himself painfully back to Lisbon, reports himself to Hill
as he passes his headquarters. Next morning “the general
himself attended me out on my road, to give me at parting
a basket with tea, sugar, bread, butter, and a large venison
pasty.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> A grateful sergeant, who bore a letter to Hill in
1813, remembers how he expected nothing but a nod and an
answer from such a great man, and was surprised to find that
the general ordered his servant to give the messenger a
supper, arranged for his billet that night, and next morn
had his haversack stuffed with bread and meat, presented
him with a dollar, and advised him where to sleep on his
return journey.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> He would give an exhausted private a
drink from the can that had just been brought for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
personal use, or find time to bestow a piece of friendly advice
on an unknown subaltern. This simple, pious, considerate
old officer, whose later portraits show a decided resemblance
to Mr. Pickwick, was known everywhere among the rank
and file as “Daddy Hill.” An officer of the 2nd Division
sums up his character in a well-written letter as follows<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>:
“The foundation of all his popularity with the troops was
his sterling worth and heroic spirit, but his popularity was
strengthened and increased as soon as he was personally
known. He was the very picture of an English country
gentleman: to the soldiers who came from the rural districts
of old England he represented <em>home</em>; his fresh complexion,
placid face, kind eyes, kind voice, the absence of all parade
or noise in his manner delighted them. The displeasure of
Sir Rowland was worse to them than the loudest anger of
other generals. His attention to all their wants and comforts,
his visits to the sick in hospital, his vigilant protection
of the poor peasantry, his just severity to marauders, his
generous treatment of such French prisoners and wounded
as fell into his hands, made for him a warm place in the hearts
of his soldiery; and where’er the survivors of that army
are now scattered, assuredly Hill’s name and image are
dearly cherished still.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Merits of Sir Rowland Hill</div>

<p>The description sounds like that of a benevolent old
squire, rather than that of a distinguished lieutenant-general.
Nevertheless, Rowland Hill was a very great
man of war. Wellington liked him as a subordinate
because of his extraordinary punctuality in obedience, and
the entire absence in him of that restless personal ambition
which makes many able men think more of opportunities
for distinguishing themselves than of exact performance
of the orders given them. Wherever Hill was, it was certain
that nothing would be risked, and nothing would be forgotten.
His beautiful combination of intelligence and
executive power more than once brought relief to his chief’s
mind in a critical moment, most of all on the march to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
Bussaco in September, 1810, when it was all-important to
Wellington’s plans that his own detached force under Hill
should join him as soon as Masséna’s similar detached force
under Reynier should have reached the main French
army. Hill executed a long and difficult march over a
mountainous country with admirable speed, and was duly
up in line on the day before the battle of Bussaco, which
could not in common prudence have been fought if he had
been late.</p>

<p>This we might have expected from a man of Hill’s
character; but what is more surprising is that when he
was trusted—a thing that did not often occur under Wellington’s
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i>—with a command in which he was allowed to
take the offensive on his own account, he displayed not
only a power of organizing, but a fierce driving energy
which none of Wellington’s more eager and restless subordinates
could have surpassed. Speedy pursuit of an
enemy on the move was not one of the great Duke’s characteristics;
he was often, and not unjustly, accused of
not making the best profit out of his victories. But Hill’s
rapid following up of Girard, in November, 1811, ending
with the complete surprise and dispersion or capture of
the French force at Arroyo dos Molinos, was a piece of work
which for swift, continuous movement, over mountain
roads, in vile rainy weather, could not have been surpassed
by the best of Napoleon’s lieutenants. Another blow of
the most creditable swiftness and daring was the storming
of the forts of Almaraz five months later, when Hill, with a
light force, plunged right into the middle of the French
cantonments and broke the all-important bridge by which
Soult and Marmont were wont to co-operate. The forts
were stormed, the bridge thoroughly destroyed, and Hill
was off, and out of reach, before the neighbouring French
divisions were half concentrated.</p>

<p>But the crowning glory of Hill’s Peninsular service was
the one general action in which he was fortunate enough to
hold independent command. This was at the end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
war, the battle of St. Pierre, near Bayonne. He was
forming the right flank of Wellington’s line when his
communication with the main army was cut off by a rise
in the river Nive, which carried away the bridges by which
he communicated with the main host. Soult, transferring
the bulk of his field force, then in front of Wellington, by
means of the bridges in Bayonne town, fell upon Hill with
five divisions. Hill had only two, those which he had
commanded for the last three years, the 2nd and Hamilton’s
(now Le Cor’s) Portuguese. With 15,000 men he fought a
defensive battle against 30,000 for the greater part of the
short December day. His reserves were used up, every
regiment had charged many times, the losses were heavy,
and it seemed hardly possible to hold on against such odds.
But Hill did so, and at last the reinforcements from the
other side of the river Nive began to appear in the late
afternoon, and Soult desisted from his attack and drew
off beaten. This was one of the most desperate pieces of
fighting in the Peninsular War, and Hill was the soul of
the defence. He was seen at every point of danger, and
repeatedly led up rallied regiments in person to save what
seemed like a lost battle. Eye-witnesses speak of him as
quite transformed from his ordinary placidity—a very
picture of warlike energy. He was even heard to swear,
a thing so rare that we are assured that this lapse from
his accustomed habits only took place twice during the
whole war. The first occasion was in the desperate melée
in the night attack that began the battle of Talavera.</p>

<div id="ip_118" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30.125em;"><p><i>PLATE II.</i></p>
<img src="images/i_118.jpg" width="482" height="600" alt="" />
<div class="caption">

<p><span class="smcap">Lord Hill, G.C.B.</span></p></div></div>

<p>It is clear that Hill was a man capable of the highest
feats in war, who might have gone very far, if he had been
given the chance of a completely independent command.
But such was not his fortune, and in his last campaign, that
of Waterloo, he was almost lost to sight, as a corps-commander
whose troops were operating always under the
immediate eye of Wellington. He survived to a good old
age, was made Commander-in-Chief of the British Army
when Wellington gave up the office on accepting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
Premiership in 1827, and held it till within a few months
of his death in 1842. Almost the last recorded words of
the kindly old man upon his death-bed were, “I have a
great deal to be thankful for; I believe I have not an enemy
in the world.” And this was literally true: to know
“Daddy Hill” was to love him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Beresford</div>

<p>The other lieutenant to whom Wellington repeatedly
entrusted a semi-independent command was one who was
neither so blameless nor so capable as Rowland Hill. Yet
William Carr Beresford was by no means to be despised
as a soldier. The illegitimate son of a great Irish peer, he
was put into a marching regiment at seventeen, and saw
an immense amount of service even for those stirring days
of the Revolutionary War, when a British officer was liable
to be sent to any of the four continents in rapid succession.
This was literally the case with Beresford, who was engaged
in India, Egypt, the Cape of Good Hope, Buenos Ayres,
and Portugal in the eight years between 1800 and 1808.</p>

<p>When the Portuguese Government asked for a British
general to reorganize their dilapidated army in 1809,
Beresford was the man selected—partly because he had the
reputation of being a good disciplinarian, partly because he
knew the Portuguese tongue, from having garrisoned
Madeira for many months, but mostly (as we are told)
because of political influence. His father’s family had never
lost sight of him, and he was well “pushed” by the Beresford
clan, who were a great power in Ireland, and had to be
conciliated by all Governments.</p>

<p>If this appointment to command the Portuguese Army
was a job, we may say (with Gilbert’s judge) that so far as
organization went, it was “a good job too.” For he
did most eminent service in creating order out of chaos,
and produced in the short space of a year a well-disciplined
force that was capable of taking a creditable part in line
with the British Army, and won well-deserved encomiums
from Wellington and every other fair critic for the part
that it took at Bussaco, its first engagement. The new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
army had not been created without much friction and
discontent: to clear out scores of incapable officers—many
of them <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">fidalgos</i> with great court influence—to promote
young and unknown men to their places, to enforce the
rigour of the conscription in a land where it existed in
theory but had always been evaded in practice, gained
Beresford immense unpopularity, which he faced in the
most stolid and unbending fashion. At last the Portuguese
Army was up to strength, and had learnt to obey as well
as to fight. The teaching had been by the most drastic
methods: Beresford cashiered officers, and shot deserters
or marauders in the rank and file, with a rigid disregard
alike for personal and court influence, and for public
opinion, which Wellington himself could not have surpassed.
He was, indeed, an honest, inflexible, and hard-working
administrator; but with this and with a personal courage
that ran almost to excess his capacities ended. His virtue
in Wellington’s eyes was that, after one short tussle of wills,
he completely and very wisely submitted himself to be the
mere instrument of his greater colleague, and did everything
that he was told to do, working the Portuguese army
to the best effect as an auxiliary force to the British, and
making no attempt to assert an independent authority.
Instead of being kept under his hand in a body, it was cut
up into brigades, each of which, with few exceptions, was
simply attached to a British division.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beresford’s Limitations</div>

<p>It was no doubt because Beresford showed himself so
obedient and loyal, and exhibited such complete self-abnegation,
that Wellington, both in 1809 and 1811, entrusted
him with the command of large detached forces
at a distance from the main army. But the marshal was
by no means up to the task entrusted to him, and after
the unhappy experiment of the first siege of Badajoz, and
the ill-fought battle of Albuera, Wellington removed him
from separate command, on the excuse that more organizing
was needed at Lisbon, and kept him either there, or with the
main army (where he had no opportunities of separate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
command) till the last year of the war. In 1814 he was for
a few weeks entrusted with the conduct of the expedition
to Bordeaux, but as it was unopposed by the enemy—and
was bound to be so, as Wellington well knew—this was
giving him no great responsibility. During the three last
years of the war he was really in a rather otiose and equivocal
position, as titular Commander-in-Chief of an army which
was not treated as a unit, but dispersed abroad among the
British divisions. Occasionally he was used as a corps
commander under Wellington’s own eye, as at Toulouse,
where he led the turning column of the 4th and 6th Divisions
which broke down Soult’s flank defences. For such a task,
when hard fighting and obedience to orders was all that
was needed, he was a fully competent lieutenant. It was
when thrown on his own resources and forced to make
decisions of his own that he showed himself so much inferior
to his successor Hill.</p>

<p>Beresford was a very tall and stalwart man of herculean
strength—every one knows of his personal encounter with
a Polish lancer at Albuera: he parried the Pole’s thrust,
caught him by the collar, and jerked him out of his saddle
and under his horse’s feet, with one twist of his powerful
arm. His features were singularly rough-cast and irregular,
and a sinister appearance was given to his face by a discoloured
and useless left eye, which had been injured in a
shooting accident when he was quite a young man. The
glare of this injured optic is said to have been discomposing
to culprits whom he had to upbraid and admonish, a task
which he always executed with thoroughness. He had
been forced to trample on so many misdemeanants, small
and great, during his five years in command of the Portuguese
army, that he enjoyed a very general unpopularity.
But I have never found any case in which he can be accused
of injustice or oppression; the fact was that he had a great
many unsatisfactory subordinates to deal with. His own
staff and the better officers of the Portuguese service liked
him well enough, and the value of his work cannot be too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
highly praised. He came little into contact with the British
part of the army, but I note that the 88th, whom he had
commanded before the war in Spain began, much preferred
him to their later chief, Picton, and had a kindly memory
of him. There are singularly few tales or anecdotes connected
with his name, from which I deduce that in British
military circles he was neither much loved nor much
hated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early Career of Graham</div>

<p>A far more picturesque figure is the third of the three
generals to whom, at one time or another, Wellington
committed the charge of a detached corps, Thomas Graham
of Balgowan, later created Lord Lynedoch. I have already
alluded to him in my preface, as in one way the most typical
figure of the epoch—the personification of all that class of
Britons who took arms against France when the Revolutionary
War broke out, as a plain duty incumbent upon
them in days when the country and Crown were in danger.
He had seen the Jacobin mob face to face in its frenzy, in
a sufficiently horrid fashion. In 1792 he had taken his
invalid wife—the beautiful Mrs. Graham of Gainsborough’s
well-known picture—to the Riviera, in the vain hope that
her consumption might be stayed. She died, nevertheless,
and he started home towards Scotland with her coffin, to
lay her in the grave of his ancestors. On the way he passed
through a town where the crazy hunt after impossible royalist
conspiracies was in full swing. A crowd of drunken National
Guards were seized with the idea that he was an emissary
in disguise, bearing arms to aristocrats. The coffin, they
declared, was probably full of pistols and daggers, and
while the unhappy husband struggled in vain to hold them
off, they broke it open, and exposed his wife’s long-dead
corpse. After this incident Thomas Graham not unnaturally
conceived the idea that his one duty in life was
to shoot Jacobins. When he had buried his wife at Methven
he was ready for that duty, and the war with France
breaking out only five months after, his opportunity was
at hand. Though a civilian, a Whig member of Parliament,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
and forty-four years of age, though he had no knowledge of
military affairs, and had never heard a shot fired in anger,
he went to the front at once, and fought through the siege
of Toulon as a sort of volunteer aide-de-camp to Lord
Mulgrave. It is odd that both Julius Cæsar and Oliver
Cromwell started at this same age as soldiers. This was
the first of an endless series of campaigns against the
French; Graham got a quasi-military status by raising
at his own expense the 90th Foot, or Perthshire Volunteers,
of which he was in reward made honorary colonel. With
the curious rank of honorary colonel—he never held any
lower—he went as British attaché to the Austrian Army
of Italy, getting the post because Englishmen who could
speak both German and Italian were rare. He saw the
unhappy campaigns of 1796–97 under Beaulieu, Würmser,
and the Archduke Charles, being thus one of the few
British observers who witnessed Bonaparte’s first essays
in strategy. Then he held staff appointments during the
operations in Minorca and Malta, and again served with
the Austrians in Italy in 1799. After much more service,
the last of it as British attaché with the army of Castaños
in Spain, during the Tudela campaign, he was at last
informed that—all precedents notwithstanding—from an
honorary colonelcy he was promoted to be a major-general
on the regular establishment, on account of his long and
distinguished service. Down to 1809 he had seen more
fighting than falls to most men, without owning any
proper military rank, for his colonelcy of 1794, which he
had held for fifteen years, was only titular and temporary,
and gave him no regular rank. He had technically
never been more than a civilian with an honorary
title!</p>

<p>Yet in 1810 he was entrusted with the important post
of commander of the British troops in Cadiz, and commenced
to take an important part in the Peninsular War.
He was now sixty-two years of age, and would have been
counted past service according to eighteenth century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
notions. But his iron frame gave no signs of approaching
decay, no fatigue or privation could tire him, and he was
one of the boldest riders in the army. His portrait shows
a man with a regular oval face, a rather melancholy expression—there
is a sad droop in the eyelids—and abundant
white hair, worn rather long. His mouth is firm and
inflexible, his general expression very resolute, but a little
tired—that of a man who has been for nearly twenty years
crusading against an enemy with whom no peace must be
made, and who does not yet see the end in sight, but
proposes to fight on till he drops. He was a fine scholar,
knew six languages, had travelled all over Europe, and
was such a master of his pen that both his dispatches and
his private letters and diary are among the best-written
and most interesting original material that exists for this
period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Graham at Barrosa</div>

<p>The crowning exploit of Graham’s life was the victory
which he won, with every chance against him, at Barrosa
on March 7th, 1811, a wonderful instance of the triumph
of a quick eye, and a sudden resolute blow over long odds.
Caught on the march by a sudden flank attack of Marshal
Victor, owing to the imbecile arrangements of the Spanish
General La Peña, under whose orders he was serving,
Graham, instead of waiting to be attacked, which would
have been fatal, took the offensive himself. His troops
were strung out on the line of march through a wood, and
there was no time to form a regular order of battle, for the
French were absolutely rushing in upon him. Victor
thought that he had before him an easy victory, over a
force surprised in an impossible posture. But Graham,
throwing out a strong line of skirmishers to hold back the
enemy for the few necessary minutes, aligned his men in
the edge of the wood, without regard for brigade or even for
battalion unity, and attacked the French with such sudden
swiftness that it was Victor, and not he, who was really
surprised. The enemy was assailed before he had formed
any line of battle, or deployed a single battalion, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
driven off the field in an hour after a most bloody fight.
Graham led the centre of his own left brigade like a general
of the Middle Ages, riding ten yards ahead of the line with
his plumed hat waving in his right hand, and his white
hair streaming in the wind. This was not the right place
for a commanding officer; but the moment was a
desperate one, and all depended on the swiftness and suddenness
of the stroke; there was no manœuvring possible,
and no further orders save to go straight on. Improvising
his battle-order in five minutes, with only 5000 men against
7000, and attacking rather uphill, he won a magnificent
victory, which would have ended in the complete destruction
of the French if the Spaniard La Peña had moved to
his aid. But that wretched officer remained halted with
his whole division only two miles from the field, and did
not stir a man to aid his colleague.</p>

<p>A few months after Barrosa, Graham was moved
from Cadiz to join the main army in Portugal, at the request
of Wellington, who gave him the command of his left
wing during the autumn campaign of 1811, and again
through the whole of that of 1813. For the greater part of
that of 1812 Graham was away on sick leave, for the first time
in his life, his eyes having given out from long exposure to
the southern sun. Unluckily for him, his promotion to
command a wing of the grand army meant that he was
generally under Wellington’s own eye, with small opportunity
of acting for himself. But his chief chose him to
take charge of the most critical operation of the Vittoria
campaign, the long flank march through the mountains
of the Tras-os-Montes, which turned the right wing of
the French and forced them out of position after position
in a running fight of 200 miles. Still outflanking the enemy,
it was he who cut in across the high-road to France at Vittoria,
and forced the beaten army of Jourdan to retire
across by-paths, with the loss of all its artillery, train,
baggage, and stores.</p>

<p>For the dramatic completeness of this splendid old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
man’s career, we could have wished that it had ended in
1813. But the Home Government, seeking for a trustworthy
officer to command the expedition to Holland in
the following winter, chose Graham to conduct it, and his
last campaign was marred by a disaster. He drove, it is
true, the remnants of the French army out of Holland,
though his force was small—only 7000 men, and formed of
raw second battalions hastily collected from English
garrisons. But his daring attempt to escalade the great
fortress of Bergen-op-Zoom, the one stronghold still held
by the enemy, was a sad failure. Taking advantage of a
hard frost, which had made the marsh-defences of that
strong town useless for the moment, Graham planned a
midnight attack by four columns, of which two succeeded
in crossing all obstacles and entering the place. But when
all seemed won, the general’s part of the scheme having
succeeded to admiration, the officers in immediate charge
of the attack ignored many of their orders, dispersed their
men in unwise petty enterprises, and finally were attacked
and driven out of the town piecemeal by the rallied
garrison. The loss was terrible, fully 2000 men, of whom
half were prisoners. But the bold conception of the
enterprise rather than its failure should be put down
to Graham’s account. The mismanagement by his
subordinates was incredible. Wellington, looking over
the fortress a year later, is said to have observed
that it must have been extremely difficult to get in.
“But,” he added, “when once in, I wonder how the
devil they ever suffered themselves to be beaten out
again.”</p>

<p>Graham’s last campaign was marred by this check.
But, in the general distribution of rewards at the peace of
1814, he was given a peerage, by the title of Lord Lynedoch,
and shared in the other honours of the Peninsular Army.
Though sixty-six years old when the war ended, he survived
till 1843, when he had reached the patriarchal age of ninety-six.
He did a good service to his old comrades by founding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
the United Service Club, which he originally designed as a
place of rendezvous for old Peninsular officers, of whom he
had noticed that many were lonely men without family
ties, like himself, while others, stranded in London for a
few days, had no central spot where they could count on
meeting old friends.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> His portrait hangs, as is right, in
the most prominent place in the largest room of the institution
which he founded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Graham and his Admirers</div>

<p>I have never found one unkindly word about General
Graham, in the numerous diaries and autobiographies of
the officers and men who served under him. All comment
on his stately presence, his thoughtful courtesy, and his
unfailing justice and benevolence. “I may truly say he
lives in their affections; they not only looked up to him
with confidence as their commander, but they esteemed and
respected him as their firm friend and protector, which,
indeed, he always showed himself to be.”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> “What could
not Britons do, when led by such a chief?” asks another.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>
I might make a considerable list of the names of British
officers who relate their personal obligation to his kindness;<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
but perhaps the most convincing evidence of all is
that of the French Colonel Vigo-Roussillon, one of the enemies
whom he captured at Barrosa, who has no words strong
enough to express the delicate generosity with which he
was treated while a wounded prisoner at Cadiz. Graham
came to visit him on his sick bed, sent his own physician
to attend him, and made copious provision for his food and
lodging. For a conscientious hatred for French influence,
whether that of the red Jacobin republic, or that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>

his benevolence to individual Frenchmen thrown upon
his mercy.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<span class="subhead">WELLINGTON’S LIEUTENANTS—PICTON, CRAUFURD,
AND OTHERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>If Graham had no enemies, and was loved by every one
with whom he came in contact, the same cannot be said of
the two distinguished officers with whom I have next to
deal, General Robert Craufurd and Sir Thomas Picton.
They were both men of mark, Craufurd even more so than
Picton; they both fell in action at the moment of victory;
they were both employed by Wellington for the most
responsible services, and he owed much to their admirable
executive powers; but both of them were occasionally
out of his good graces. Each of them had many admiring
friends and many bitter enemies, whose reasons for liking
and disliking them it is not hard to discover. Both of
them were to a certain extent embittered and disappointed
men, who thought that their work had never received
adequate recognition, a view for which there was considerable
justification. In other respects they were wholly
unlike; their characters differed fundamentally, so much
so that when they met it was not unfrequently to clash and
quarrel.</p>

<p>Picton, a Welsh country gentleman by birth, was a
typical eighteenth century soldier, who had (after the old
fashion) entered the army at thirteen years of age, and had
gone on foreign service at fifteen. His manners, we gather,
were those of the barrack-room; he was a hard drinking,
hard swearing, rough-and-ready customer. Wellington,
who was not squeamish, called him “a rough, foul-mouthed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
devil as ever lived,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> but he always behaved extremely
well on service.” The notorious Duke of Queensberry,
“Old Q,” was his friend and admirer, and left him a good
legacy of £5000 in his will. Old Q’s model heroes were not
of the Wesleyan Methodist type. One of the strongest
impressions left on one’s mind by the diaries of those who
served under him is that of his astounding power of malediction.
Kincaid’s account of the sack of Ciudad Rodrigo is
dominated by “the voice of Sir Thomas Picton, with the
power of twenty trumpets proclaiming damnation to all
and sundry.”<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> But if he was destitute of all the graces
and some of the virtues, Picton was a very fine soldier,
with a quick eye, unlimited self-confidence, and the courage
of ten bulldogs. He had, when once the Revolutionary
War commenced, made his way to the front with great
rapidity. A captain in 1794, he had become a brigadier-general
by 1799, and his promotion had been won by undeniable
good service. For his ultimate misfortune, he
was made in 1797 governor of the newly conquered Spanish
island of Trinidad in the West Indies, while still only a
colonel. This was the beginning of his troubles; the post
was lucrative, dangerous, and difficult. The garrison was
insufficient, and the island was swarming with disbanded
Spanish soldiers, runaway negro slaves, French adventurers,
and privateers and pirates of all nations from the Spanish
Main. Picton had to create order from chaos, and then to
keep it up; his methods were drastic: the lash and the
pillory, the branding-irons, and, where necessary, military
execution. It does not appear on impartial examination
that he ever showed himself self-seeking, partial, or corrupt
in his administration; he merely tried, in his own rough
way, to dragoon into order a very unruly and lawless
community. The majority of the better classes approved
his rule, which, as one of them said, “was of the sort
required by the colony” where a governor “had to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
himself feared as well as beloved.” Naturally he made
many enemies, white, black, and brown, English and
Spanish, adventurers and officials. They kept up a rain
of petitions against him at the Colonial Office, in which he
was represented as a sort of Nero. The most acrid and
ingenious of them, a Colonel Fullarton, succeeded in finding
a method of attack which was certain to have a great
vogue when tried in England. The old Spanish law still
ran in Trinidad, and under it various forms of durance and
torture were permitted against suspected persons under
arrest. A case had happened in which a mulatto girl, who
had been concerned in stealing 2000 dollars from a Spanish
tobacco merchant, was put to the barbarous punishment
of picketing (standing with the heels on a stake) by the local
magistrates, to make her confess who had taken the money,
and where it was hidden. After a few minutes she admitted
that her lover had stolen it, with her aid and consent;
and this was proved to be the fact. Thus under Picton’s
rule, and (as it turned out) with his knowledge, a woman
had been put to the torture, though the torture was slight
and the woman guilty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Picton in Trinidad</div>

<p>Picton, on returning to England, was therefore accused
by Colonel Fullarton of many tyrannical acts, but, above
all, of having put a woman to the torture in order to extract
a confession, a thing abhorrent alike to the laws of England
and to the common sentiments of humanity. There followed
a long political trial, (for it became a matter of Whig
and Tory partizanship), in which the Government finally
dropped the prosecution, because it was amply proved that
Spanish, not English, law was running in Trinidad in 1801,
since the island had not been annexed till the peace of
Amiens in the following year, and that the governor had
simply allowed the local magistrates to act according to
their usual practice. The other charges all fell through.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the mud stuck, as Fullarton had intended,
and Picton was generally remembered as the man who had
permitted a woman to be tortured. The trial had dragged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
over several years, and had been most costly to the accused.
Since there had been no verdict, owing to the prosecution
having simply been dropped, he had not even the satisfaction
of being able to say that he had been acquitted by a
jury of his countrymen. There was a sort of slur, however
unjust, upon his name.</p>

<p>It therefore argued considerable independence and disregard
of public opinion on the part of Wellington, when
he wrote home to ask that Picton might be sent out to him
to command a division,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> purely on his military record as a
hard fighter. The general came out to Portugal with a
name unfavourably known, and to colleagues and subordinates
who were prepared to view him with a critical
eye. “It is impossible to deny,” writes an officer who
served under him, “that a very strong dislike towards the
general was prevalent. His conduct in the island of
Trinidad ... had impressed all ranks with an unfavourable
opinion of the man. His first appearance was looked for
with no little anxiety. When he reached the ground,
accompanied by his staff, every eye was turned towards
him, and his appearance and demeanour were closely
observed. He looked to be a man between fifty and sixty,
and I never saw a more perfect specimen of a splendid-looking
soldier. In vain did those who had set him down
as a cruel tyrant seek to find out such a delineation in his
countenance. On the contrary, there was a manly open
frankness in his appearance that gave a flat contradiction
to the slander. And in truth Picton was <em>not</em> a tyrant, nor
did he ever act as such during the many years that he
commanded the 3rd Division. But if his countenance did
not depict him as cruel, there was a sarcastic severity
about it, and a certain curl of the lip, that marked him as
one who despised rather than courted applause. The
stern countenance, robust frame, caustic speech, and
austere demeanour told in legible characters that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
one not likely to say a thing and then not do as he had said.
In a word, his appearance denoted him a man of strong
mind and strong frame.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Picton and the 88th Foot</div>

<p>It was considered characteristic that he ended his first
inspection of the division by holding a drum-head court-martial
on two soldiers who had stolen a goat, and witnessing
their punishment. He then rode up to the regiment to
which the culprits belonged, the 88th, and “in language
not of that bearing which an officer of his rank should use,”
said, “You are not known in the army by the name of
Connaught Rangers, but by the name of Connaught <em>footpads</em>,”
with some unnecessary remarks on their country
and their religion.</p>

<p>This untoward incident was the commencement of a
long feud between Picton and the 88th, which endured all
through the war, and led, at the end of it, to the Rangers
refusing to subscribe to the laudatory address and plate
which the rest of the 3rd Division offered to their general,
after nearly five years of glorious service. Yet the feud
was not incompatible with a good deal of reluctant esteem
on both sides. On the morning after the storm of Ciudad
Rodrigo, in which the Rangers had taken a most gallant
part, we are told that some of the men, more than usually
elated in spirits, called out to their commander, “Well,
general, we gave you a cheer last night: it’s your turn now.”
Picton, smiling, took off his hat and said, “Here, then,
you drunken set of brave rascals, hurrah! And we’ll soon
be at Badajoz,” to which scene of even greater glory for
the 3rd Division he did conduct them within a few weeks.</p>

<p>The considerable string of stories, true, half-true, or
apocryphal, which cling round the name of Picton relate
in about equal proportions, on the one hand, to his extreme
intrepidity and coolness in action, and, on the other, to
his vehemence alike of language and of action, which
struck terror into the objects of his wrath. The best of
the former with which I am acquainted comes from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
same diarist, Grattan, of the 88th, whom I have already
been quoting. It relates to the day of El Bodon (September
25, 1811), when the 3rd Division, caught in a somewhat
isolated position owing to one of Wellington’s few tactical
slips, was retreating in column across a level upland,
beset by Montbrun and three brigades of French cavalry.
“For six miles across a perfect flat, without the slightest
protection from any incident of the ground, without
artillery, almost without cavalry, did the 3rd Division
continue its march. During the whole time the French
cavalry never quitted us, and six light guns, advancing with
them and taking the division in flank and rear, poured in a
frightful fire of grape and canister. General Picton conducted
himself with his accustomed coolness. He rode on
the left flank of the column, and repeatedly cautioned the
different battalions to mind the quarter distance and the
‘tellings off.’ At last we got within a mile of our entrenched
camp at Fuente Guinaldo, when Montbrun, impatient lest
his prey should escape from his grasp, ordered his troopers
to bring up their right shoulders and incline towards our
column. The movement was not exactly bringing up his
squadrons into line, but it was the next thing to it. They
were within half pistol-shot of us. Picton took off his hat,
and holding it over his eyes as a shade from the sun, looked
sternly but anxiously at the French. The clatter of the
horses and the clanking of the scabbards were so great, as
the right squadron moved up, that many thought it the
forerunner of a general charge. Some mounted officer
called out, ‘Had we not better form square?’ ‘No,’
replied Picton; ‘it is but a <em>ruse</em> to frighten us, and it <em>won’t
do</em>.’ In half an hour more we were safe within our
lines.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>This was a fine example of cool resolution, and ended
happily what had been a very anxious hour for Wellington.
But I imagine that the occasion on which the Commander-in-Chief
owed most to the commander of the 3rd Division<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
was the storm of Badajoz. It will be remembered that
on that bloody night the main attack on the breaches failed
completely, despite of the desperate exertions of the 4th
and Light Divisions. The attempt by escalade upon the
towering walls of the castle, which proved successful and
caused the fall of the fortress, had not been in Wellington’s
original plan, but was suggested to him by Picton, who had
viewed the breaches, and had not been convinced that they
could be carried. Picton pleaded that he might be
allowed to try the castle with his own division as a subsidiary
operation.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> He succeeded triumphantly, and so
saved the day. If he had not made his offer, the chance of
the city’s falling would have been infinitely less, even though
a brigade of the 5th Division did succeed in entering Badajoz
at another point remote from the fatal breaches. Though
Picton got plenty of praise for his courage on this night, it
was not generally known that he ought to have been praised
even more for his prescience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Picton at Badajoz</div>

<p>Numberless instances of Picton’s skill and tenacity
might be quoted, all through the six years of his service
under Wellington. But the anecdote which best illustrates
his Spartan courage is one which belongs to the last three
days of his life. At Quatre Bras, where his division so
long held back the vehement attacks of Ney, he received a
musket ball in his left side, which, though it gave a somewhat
glancing blow and did not penetrate, broke two of
his ribs. Believing that the battle would be continued
next day, he resolved not to return himself as wounded,
lest the surgeons should insist on sending him to the rear.
He roughly bound up the wound with the assistance of
his soldier servant, and was on his horse throughout June
17, conducting the retreat of his division. On the 18th, as
every one knows, he was killed—shot through the head—while
leading the decisive charge which beat d’Erlon’s
corps from the heights of Mont St. Jean. Only when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
his body was stripped, to be laid in the coffin, was it discovered
that he had gone into action at Waterloo with a
dangerous, perhaps mortal, wound two days old upon him.
For his side was so swollen and blackened around the
broken ribs, that the surgeons thought that the neglected
wound might very possibly have caused his death, if he had
come unharmed through the battle of June 18.</p>

<p>Such virtues were not incompatible with grave faults.
Picton’s violent language and reckless disregard of common
forms of propriety form the subject of many tales. When
he thought that the assistant engineer who guided the 3rd
Division at the storm of Badajoz had led them astray, he
drew his sword, and with an oath said that he would cut the
blind fool down if he had gone wrong. This we have on
the first-hand evidence of that officer, who was fortunately
able to demonstrate that the right path had been taken.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>
A better-known tale is that of Picton and the commissary,
a story which has also been attributed to Craufurd, and
recently by Mr. Fortescue to General Sherbrooke. The commissary
had been ordered, during one of Wellington’s long
marches, to have the rations of the 3rd Division ready at a
certain spot at a certain hour. They were not forthcoming,
but only a series of excuses, to account for their non-arrival.
Picton grimly pointed to a neighbouring tree and said,
“Well, sir, if you don’t get the rations for my division to
the place mentioned by twelve o’clock to-morrow, I will
hang you on it at half-past.” The commissary rode
straight to Lord Wellington and complained, with much
injured dignity, of the general’s violent and ungentlemanly
language. His lordship coolly remarked, “Oh, he said
that he’d <em>hang</em> you, did he?” “Yes, my lord.” “Well,
General Picton is a man of his word. I think you’d better
get the rations up in time.” Further advice was unnecessary;
the rations were there to the moment.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> It is
odd to find that many years after Picton’s death a question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
was asked in Parliament, and a controversy raged in the
newspapers, as to which of three named commissaries was
the object of Picton’s anger.</p>

<p>It would be wrong, however, to paint Picton as a mere
vial of wrath, foaming into ungovernable rage in and out
of season. When he was angry he generally had good
cause; it was only the over-vehemence of his language
that caused him to become a centre of legends. Odd as it
may seem, the rank and file did not consider him a tyrant;
it was acknowledged that he was very just, that he never
punished without hearing the defence, that he was capable
of pardoning, that when he hit hard he did so not without
reason. A sergeant of the 45th wrote on him thus: “He
was strict sometimes, especially about plunder, always
talking about how wrong it was to plunder the poor people
because countries happened to be at war. He used to
flog the men when they were found out; but where he
flogged, many generals took life. Besides this, the men
thought that he had their welfare at heart. Every soldier
in the division knew that if he had anything to complain
of, ‘Old Picton’ would listen to his story, and set him
right if he could. On the whole, our fellows always thought
him a <em>kind</em> general, in spite of his strong language.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Picton and Wellington</div>

<p>This same sense of justice is brought out in the diaries
of several officers, who speak in feeling terms of his endeavours
to get obscure merit rewarded, and to keep
down jobbery in promotion,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> or tyranny of senior officers
over their juniors. He was very accessible, and even
friendly and considerate, to his subordinates. This familiarity,
which endeared him to subalterns, was (as we have
already noticed) not agreeable to Lord Wellington. Their
intercourse was formal and not very frequent. Wellington
once went out of his way to say that it was not true that he
had ever had a quarrel with Picton, or been on anything
but good terms with him. But while acknowledging his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
services, he never pretended that he had any personal liking
for him.</p>

<p>Picton always thought that he suffered grave injustice
at the end of the war, by not being included in the list of
five Peninsular officers who were made peers for their
services. “If the coronet were lying on the crown of a
breach, I should have as good a chance as any of them,”
was his caustic remark. The explanation formally given
for his omission was that all the five generals honoured,
Beresford, Hill, Graham, Hope, and Stapleton Cotton,
had held for some time “distinct commands,” and that
Picton had not. But though this explanation held good
for the first three, it did not really cover the cases of Hope
and Cotton, whose independent commands had been little
more than nominal; and Picton had on several occasions—notably
in the Pyrenees—exercised independent authority
in a very similar way. The fact was that he was an unpopular
man, and that the Ministry omitted him, while
Wellington made no effort to push his claims. He showed
his displeasure by announcing his intention to retire from
the army in 1814, and would have done so in the next year,
if Napoleon’s return from Elba had not called him into the
field, to die at Waterloo.</p>

<p>To finish our sketch of this curious and contradictory
character, we must mention that Picton was a profound
despiser of all sorts of pomp and ceremony. His dress,
except on gala days, was careless and often unmilitary.
He fought Quatre-Bras, as several witnesses remarked, in
a tall beaver hat, and in the Vittoria campaign, because he
was suffering from his eyes, wore a very broad-brimmed
variety of the same type. His aide-de-camps copied him,
as was natural, in their disregard for appearance, and it is
said that from their manners and dress they were known
as “the bear and ragged staff,”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> a term that has been
applied on several more recent occasions to similar
parties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">General Robert Craufurd</div>

<p>A very different man from Sir Thomas Picton was the
last of the divisional generals whose character we have to
deal with, Robert Craufurd. They were both effective
weapons in the hands of Wellington, but Picton’s efficiency
was rather that of the battering ram, while Craufurd’s
was rather that of the rapier. Robert Craufurd, like
Picton, came to the Peninsula as rather a disappointed
man, his grievance being that, despite much brilliant service,
he had dropped behind in promotion, and found himself a
junior brigadier-general, when men several years his junior,
like Hill, Beresford, and Wellington himself, were holding
posts of much greater importance. Craufurd was one of
our few scientific soldiers; he had studied so far back as
1782 the tactics of the army of Frederic the Great at Berlin,
and had translated into English the official Prussian treatise
on the Art of War. His knowledge of German, which
none other of Wellington’s officers save Graham possessed,
had caused him, in 1794, to be given the important post of
military attaché with the Austrian Army in the Netherlands,
and afterwards on the Rhine, and he followed Coburg and
the Archduke Charles for three years through a series of
campaigns, in which failure was much more frequent than
success. When the war broke out once more between
Austria and the French republic, he was again sent in 1799
to serve with his old friends, and accompanied the headquarters
of General Hotze’s army in Switzerland, till he was
called off to share in the Duke of York’s ill-managed invasion
of Holland in the end of the same year. Like
Graham, therefore, Craufurd had the sorrow of witnessing
a long series of disasters, for which he was not in the least
responsible. As his reports and dispatches show, he discharged
his duty with zeal and excellent capacity; but his
sarcastic tongue and violent temper seem to have stood in the
way of his promotion. A major in 1794, after thirteen years’
service, he was still only a lieutenant-colonel in 1801, and
during these years had seen numberless comrades climb
over his head, though he had all the while been discharging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
important duties in a fashion which won the admiration of
all with whom he came into personal contact. It looks as
if the constant reports of disaster, which he had to make,
had connected his name in official circles with the notion
of ill-luck. In 1801, disappointed of an official post in
Ireland for which he had applied, he went on half-pay,
and entered Parliament as member for a pocket-borough
which chanced to be in his brother’s gift.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> For the next
five years he was a constant speaker in Parliament on
military topics, and a very bitter critic of the policy of
Pitt, Dundas, and Addington. His views as to the proper
organization of the British forces, in first and second line,
for the beating off of French invasion were set forth at
vast length, and always clashed with those of ministers.
It is only fair to say that he was in the main right, and they
wrong; he pleaded for the reduction of the numberless
ill-disciplined volunteer corps, and wished to see in the
first line a very large regular army raised for short service,
and behind it the second line, levied by conscription, as a
sort of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">levée en masse</i> trained for irregular fighting, and not
expected to manœuvre or to take part in pitched battles.
Craufurd’s virulent criticism was very telling, but hardly
likely to help his promotion as a military man, so long as
the Addington and Pitt ministries were in power. When,
however, Pitt died, and the Whig administration called
“All the Talents” came into power, the new War Secretary,
William Windham, was disposed to do everything possible
for Craufurd, who was not only his personal friend, but
often advised him on matters of organization and technical
military subjects.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Craufurd at Buenos Ayres</div>

<p>At last, after five years spent in rather acrid parliamentary
criticism, Craufurd was given an opportunity by
his friend Windham to see service in a higher post than
had ever before fallen to his lot. Though only just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
promoted to a full colonelcy, he was given the command of
a brigade of 4000 men, destined for a distant expedition.
This adventure was one of the most hare-brained of the
many futile schemes of the unlucky cabinet then in power.
Craufurd was to take in hand nothing less than a voyage round
Cape Horn, for the conquest of Chili! He never saw the
straits of Magellan, however, for his force, after it had sailed,
was distracted to form part of the unhappy armament
under General Whitelocke, which made the disastrous
attack on Buenos Ayres in 1807. Placed in the front,
in command of Whitelocke’s Light Brigade, and thrust
forward into the tangle of streets among which the incapable
general dispersed his troops in many small columns, Craufurd
fought his way so far on that he was surrounded, cut
off from the main body, and compelled to capitulate with
the remnants of his men. Thus his first chance of distinction
in the field, at the head of a considerable force,
ended in absolute disaster. He was acquitted of all blame
at Whitelocke’s court-martial, but the thought that he was
remembered as the officer who had surrendered a British
brigade rankled in his mind, and sat heavy on his soul
down to the end of his life.</p>

<p>The fact that he was held blameless, however, was
marked by his appointment to the command of a brigade
in the Peninsular Army in 1808. But his usual ill-luck
seemed at first to attend him. He arrived too late for
Vimeiro; when serving under Moore he was detached
from the main army, and did not fight at Corunna. In
the next year, returning to serve under Wellesley, he was
late for Talavera, though to reach the battlefield he
made his well-remembered march of forty-three miles in
twenty-six hours, which Napier, by a slip of memory,
has converted into an impossible achievement—a march
of sixty-two miles in that time, which not even Craufurd
and the famous 43rd, 52nd, and 95th could have accomplished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Craufurd and the Light Division</div>

<p>From 1809 onward Craufurd at last got his chance, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
for the greater part of three years<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> was in command of
Wellington’s advance, his “Light Brigade” of 1809 becoming
the “Light Division” in 1810. At length he got what Fate
had denied him in all his earlier career, a post of great
distinction and responsibility, and a sight of victory; for
fifteen years he had been witnessing nothing but retreats
and disasters. On his happy days, and they were many,
Craufurd was undoubtedly the most brilliant lieutenant
that Wellington ever owned. Yet he was not trusted by
his chief as Hill, for example, was trusted, because of
his occasional lapses from caution, and from the blind
obedience which his chief exacted. Occasionally he
took risks, or ventured to modify the orders given
him—the faults of an eager and ambitious spirit in an hour
of excitement.</p>

<p>His achievements were great and noble. The most
splendid of them was the protection of the north-east
frontier of Portugal throughout the whole spring and summer
of 1810, when he was set with his own small division and
two regiments of cavalry to lie out many miles in front of
the main army, and to watch the assembling host of
Masséna, till the moment when it should make its forward
move for serious invasion. For five months he guarded a
long front against an enemy of sixfold force, without
allowing his line to be pierced, or suffering the French to
gain any information as to what was going on in his rear.
This was a great feat, only accomplished by the most
complete and minute organization of his very modest
resources. There were fifteen fords along the Agueda,
the river whose line he had to keep, all of which had to be
watched in dry weather, and many even when the stream
was high. The French had 3000 cavalry opposite him in
March and April, 5000 in May and June, the latter a force
exceeding in numbers the total of his whole division.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
Behind the hostile cavalry screen he knew that there were
two full army corps, or over 40,000 men; and many
detachments of this infantry lay only four or five miles from
Craufurd’s outposts, and might attack him at any moment.
Yet he never suffered any surprise; so well were his observation-posts
placed and managed, that the least movement of
the enemy was reported to him in an incredibly short
time. The whole web of communications quivered at the
slightest touch, and the Light Division was concentrated
ready to fight or to retreat, as prudence dictated, long
before the attack could develop. So wonderfully had he
trained his troops that any battalion, as Napier records, was
ready under arms within seven minutes from the first alarm
signal, and within a quarter of an hour could be in order of
battle on its appointed post, with its baggage loaded and
assembled ready for departure at a convenient distance
to the rear.</p>

<p>As his aide-de-camp, Shaw Kennedy, the historian of
this summer, writes, “To understand Craufurd’s operations
the <em>calculation</em> must never be lost sight of, for it was on
calculation that he acted all along.” Special reports were
made of the numerous fords of the Agueda <em>every</em> morning,
and the rapidity of its rises was periodically marked.
Beacons were placed on conspicuous heights, so as to
communicate information as to the enemy’s offensive
movements. To ensure against mistakes in the night,
pointers were kept at the stations of communication,
directed to the beacons. The cavalry regiment at the
outposts was the first Hussars of the King’s German
Legion, a veteran corps, chosen because its officers were
considered superior in scouting power to that of any other
light cavalry unit with the army. Craufurd, knowing
German well, communicated with each of its squadron
leaders directly; each knew his own duty for the front that
he covered, and each worked out his part admirably. The
general was untiring, could remain on horseback unwearied
for almost any length of time, and knew personally every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
ford, defile, and by-path. Hence nothing was left to
chance.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Craufurd and Wellington</div>

<p>It was a pity that Craufurd ended this splendid piece
of service, which lasted over five months of daily danger,
by fighting the unnecessary “Combat of the Coa” on
July 4, 1810. Staying a day too long beyond that stream
despite of Wellington’s clear direction to retire the moment
that he was hard pressed, he was suddenly attacked by the
whole of Ney’s corps, 20,000 men or more, and forced over
the Coa, with loss which might have been great but for the
excellence of the battalions he had trained and the cool-headed
tactical skill of his regimental officers. He held the
bridge of the Coa successfully when he had crossed it, and lost
no more than 300 men; but he had disobeyed orders and
risked his division. Wellington was justly displeased, and
let his lieutenant know it. But he did not rebuke him in
his dispatches, and continued him in his command. He
wrote home in a confidential letter, “You will say, ‘Why
not accuse Craufurd?’ I answer, ‘Because if I am to be
hanged for it, I cannot accuse a man who meant well, and
whose error was one of judgment, not of intention.’”
But for the future he kept Craufurd nearer to himself, and
did not place him so far away that he had much chance of
trying strategical experiments on his own responsibility.
Even so, there were other occasions on which the general’s
proneness to think for himself got him into trouble. One
was on September 25, 1811, on the day of the combat of
El Bodon, when Craufurd, thrown forward into a hazardous
position by his chief’s orders, was twelve hours late in
joining the main army. He had been told to make a night
march, but waited till dawn, because he was moving in
a difficult and broken country full of ravines and torrents,
where he judged that movement in the dark was dangerous.
By his delay the army was concentrated half a day later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
than Wellington intended. “I am glad to see you safe,”
observed the Commander-in-Chief with some asperity, as
the Light Division filed into the scantily manned position
at Fuente Guinaldo. “Oh, I was in no danger, I assure
you.” “But <em>I</em> was, from your conduct,” answered Wellington.
Whereupon Craufurd remarked to his staff, “He’s
d——d crusty to-day.”<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> In this case it must be remarked,
in justice to Craufurd, that it was his chief who had placed
him in the hazardous position, not himself, and that his
judgment that the night march was impracticable was very
probably correct. But he had disobeyed an order, and it
was remembered against him by the inflexible Wellington.</p>

<p>Against these lapses must be set a long career of careful
and scientific soldiering, with movements of brilliant
manœuvring, and sudden strokes, in which no other Peninsular
general could vie with him. The repulse of Ney’s corps
at Bussaco was perhaps the most glorious exploit of Craufurd
and his Light Division. The way in which the French
on this occasion were detained and harassed by light
troops, and then, just as they reached the crest of the
position, charged and swept downhill by the rush of a
much inferior force, launched at the right moment, was a
beautiful example of tactics. The most astonishing part
of it was that, by his careful choice of a position, and
judicious concealment of his line till the critical minute,
Craufurd beat his enemy with hardly any loss; he had
only 177 casualties, the French opposed to him over 1200.
Yet there was another feat which, though less showy, was
probably an even greater example of tactical skill than the
stroke at Bussaco. This was the advance and retreat of
the Light Division at Fuentes de Oñoro (May 5, 1811),
when Craufurd was sent out of the main British position
to rescue the 7th Division, which was cut off and nearly
surrounded by an overwhelming force of French cavalry.
Having disengaged the compromised division, Craufurd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
had to retreat back to the main body with five brigades
of fine cavalry, aided by horse artillery, surging round him
on all sides, and seeking for an opportunity to burst in.
To retreat in square across two miles of open plateau, very
well adapted for the action of horsemen, was a delicate
and dangerous task. Yet Craufurd achieved it with perfect
security, and brought in his whole division to Wellington’s
position with a loss of less than fifty men. As an exhibition
of nerve and skill it even exceeded Picton’s retreat at El
Bodon, for the French horse on this occasion were more
numerous, and flushed with previous success, and the Light
Division was a smaller body than the 3rd division by 4000
men to 5200. The distance covered, however, during the
crisis of retreat at Fuentes was much shorter, only two miles
to seven at El Bodon.</p>

<p>Craufurd fell in action before 1812 was many days old,
being killed by a chance shot while watching and directing
the storm of the lesser breach at Ciudad Rodrigo from the
further side of the glacis (January 19). Otherwise his
peculiar talents would no doubt have been exhibited in
commanding the rear-guard during the retreat from Burgos,
and the advance during the campaign of Vittoria. The
character of the fighting in the Pyrenees would also have
suited admirably his particular style of management. He
was bitterly missed by his officers, Charles Alten, his
successor in command of the Light Division being a general
of much more pedestrian quality,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> who might never fail to
make an attempt to obey Wellington’s orders to the best
of his ability, but could never supplement them by any
improvisation of his own, of which he was incapable. The
operations of the Light Division after Craufurd’s death were
always admirable so far as the conduct of officers and men
went, but there was no longer any genius in the way in which
they were led.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Craufurd’s Faults</div>

<p>Craufurd, unlike Hill or Graham, and like his rival
Picton, had many enemies. He was a strict disciplinarian,
to his officers even more than to his men, and had a quick
temper and a caustic tongue. His anger used to vent
itself not in bursts of swearing, such as Picton would indulge
in, but by well-framed and lucid speeches of bitter
sarcasm, which probably gave more offence than any
amount of oaths. Being a highly educated man, and a
practised parliamentary speaker, he could put an amount
of polished contempt into a rebuke which was not easily
forgotten. It was probably this trick that made enemies
of the Napiers, both of whom speak very bitterly of him
in their diaries and other writings, though William Napier
in his history gives him the due credit for his many brilliant
achievements.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> Several others of his officers speak bitterly
of his intellectual arrogance; one calls him a “tyrant”;
another says that he never forgot a grudge. But he had
no fewer friends than enemies; many of the best of his subordinates,
like Shaw Kennedy and Campbell, loved him well,
and (what is more surprising) the rank and file, on whom
his wrath often fell in the form of the lash, felt not only
confidence but enthusiasm for him. The best of all his
eulogies comes from a 95th man, Rifleman Harris, and is
well worth quoting, for its simple manliness.</p>

<p>“I do not think I ever admired any man who wore the
British uniform more than I did General Craufurd. I
could fill a book with descriptions of him, for I frequently
had my eye upon him in the hurry of action. The Rifles
liked him, but they feared him, for he could be terrible
when insubordination showed itself in the ranks. ‘You
think because you are riflemen that you may do whatever
you think proper,’ said he one day to the miserable and
savage crew around him on the retreat to Corunna; ‘but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
I’ll teach you the difference before I have done with you.’
I remember one evening during that retreat he detected
two men straying away from the main body; it was in
an early stage of that disastrous flight, and Craufurd knew
that he must keep his division together. He halted the
brigade with a voice of thunder, ordered a drum-head
court-martial on the instant, and they were sentenced to
a hundred a-piece. While the hasty trial was taking place,
Craufurd, dismounting from his horse, stood in the midst,
looking stern and angry as a worried bulldog. He did not
like retreating, that man.</p>

<p>“When the trial was over, it was too dark to inflict
the punishment. He marched all night on foot, and when
morning dawned his hair, beard, and eyebrows were covered
with the frost; we were all in the same condition. Scarcely
had dawn appeared when the general called a halt, among
the snow on the hills. Ordering a square to be formed, he
spoke to the brigade.</p>

<p>“‘Although I shall obtain the good will neither of the
officers nor of the men here by so doing, I am resolved to
punish those men according to the sentence awarded, even
though the French are at our heels. Begin with Daniel
Howans.’</p>

<p>“The men were brought out, and their Lieutenant-Colonel,
Hamilton Wade, at the same time stepped forward,
and lowering his sword, requested he would forgive these
men, as they were both of them good soldiers, who had
fought in all the battles of Portugal. ‘I order <em>you</em>, sir,’
said the general, ‘to do your duty. These men shall be
punished.’ After seventy-five lashes, Craufurd stopped the
flogging. But before he put the brigade in motion again,
he gave us another short address, pretty much after this
<span class="locked">style—</span></p>

<p>“‘I give you all notice that I shall halt the brigade
again the very first moment I perceive any man disobeying
my orders, and try him by court-martial on the spot.’ He
then gave the word, and we resumed our march.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Craufurd’s Severity</div>

<p>“Many who read this may suppose that it was a cruel
and unnecessary severity, under the dreadful and harassing
circumstances of that retreat: but I, who was there, a
common soldier in the regiment to which these men belonged,
say that it was quite necessary. No man but one formed
of stuff like General Craufurd could have saved the brigade
from perishing altogether. If he flogged two, he saved
hundreds from death by his management.”</p>

<p>There was a curious anecdote concerning Craufurd’s
funeral published in the <cite>Saturday Review</cite> lately,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> from the
unpublished reminiscences of a contemporary, which illustrates
well enough the reverence with which the Light
Division looked upon its old chief. One of his strongest
principles had been that troops on the march must never
make a detour to avoid fordable streams or deep mud, nor
break their ranks to allow each man to pick shallow water,
or hard stones among the wet. The delay so caused was,
he held, such a hindrance to rapid movement that it must
not be allowed. He had been known to flog men who
straggled from the ranks in the water, in order to fill their
bottles, or to stoop down to take a long drink.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> He had
even caused an officer, whom he caught evading a wetting
by riding pick-a-back upon his soldier-servant, to be set
down with a splash in the middle of a stream.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> Coming
back from Craufurd’s funeral, the leading company of the
Light Division passed by an excavation at the rear of the
siege works, half-filled by mud and water. Instead of
turning its end to avoid the wet, the men looked at the
inundation, pulled themselves together, and marched
straight through it, with great regularity and steadiness,
as if they were passing before a general officer at a review.
The whole division followed through the slush. It seemed
to them that the best testimony to their old commander’s
memory was to honour his best-known theory, when he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
no longer there to enforce its acceptance by his usual
drastic methods.</p>

<p>I could write much more of this notable character, with
all its faults and merits. But so much must suffice. Nor
have I space to tell of the other senior generals of the
Peninsular War, though some of them, such as Leith and
Cole, were great fighting men, just the tools that suited
Wellington’s hand. They were, however, never trusted
with independent commands, so that it is impossible to
judge of their full mental stature. I should be inclined to
think very highly of Cole from his conduct at Albuera, for
it was he who ordered, on his own responsibility, without
any permission from Beresford, the famous advance of the
Fusilier Brigade and Harvey’s Portuguese, which turned
into a victory that most perilous battle.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> But of most
of Wellington’s divisional officers we can only say that they
were competent for the task set them—the vigorous carrying
out of orders which were given them, but in whose
framing they had no part. At the most, tactical skill in
execution can be attributed to them, and of this there
was no lack, as witness details of Salamanca, Vittoria, and
the scattered fighting in the Pyrenees. Almost as much
can be predicated of some of the great brigadiers, who
managed their details well, but never had the chance of
showing their full powers. It would be easy to make a
long list of them; at least Kempt, Pack, Barns, Mackinnon,
Colborne, Hay, Lumley, Ross, Halkett, Byng, Pakenham,
Beckwith, and Barnard should be included in the list.
Some of them died or were invalided early, others commanded
brigades at Waterloo again, but none, save Byng,
of this string of names, was ever given permanent command
of a division, though several of them had held the interim
charge of one in the Peninsula, when their regular chiefs
were sick or absent. Ross and Pakenham alone were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
promoted to a separate command, both in America. The
former had charge of the expedition which went to the
Potomac and Chesapeake in 1813–14; he took Washington
by a vigorous stroke, but fell in action shortly after, while
conducting an attack on Baltimore, which ceased when he
fell. Pakenham’s expedition to New Orleans was a series
of misfortunes, of which some part at least must be attributed
to his own fault. It is certain that Wellington never
trained a general who proved himself a first-rate exponent
of the art of war; but his system (as we have said above)
was not calculated to foster initiative or self-reliance among
his lieutenants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some Unsatisfactory Subordinates</div>

<p>Other subordinates Wellington possessed, of whom we
can say that they were not up to their work, even in the
carrying out of the orders given them with common self-reliance
and clear-headedness. Such were Spencer and
Slade, who were only capable of going forward to carry
out a definite order; it was necessary, so to speak, that
they should simply be put like trams on a line, and shoved
forward, or they would slacken the pace and come to a
stop, from want of initiative and moving power. Some
few, like Sir William Erskine, who was Wellington’s pet
aversion—yet irremovable because of the political influence
that backed him—were positively dangerous from a combination
of short-sightedness, carelessness, and self-will.
In one dispatch Wellington says that he thinks that he
is a little wrong in his head.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> It is astounding that after
Erskine’s mistakes at Casal Novo and Sabugal, Wellington
did not get rid of him at all costs; but he simply tried to
shunt him on to commands where it was unlikely that he
could do much harm, and continued solemnly to rehearse
his name with approval in his dispatches, along with those
of all other officers of his rank, till the unfortunate man
committed suicide, in a moment of insanity, in the interval
between the campaigns of 1812 and 1813. This was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
strongest case of difficulty which Wellington, for reasons
of politics and patronage at home, did not care to face by
the decisive step of sending home the general in disgrace.
But there were several brigadier-generals whom he had not
asked for, whom he disliked, and whose departure from the
Peninsula he saluted with a small psalm of thanksgiving in
his private letters.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> It is certainly astonishing that, even
after 1811, he was not given a free hand to get rid of subordinates
whom he knew to be incompetent or recalcitrant,
any more than he was given the power to promote officers
without a tedious reference to the Horse Guards. It is
true that in the later years of the war his recommendations
were generally (but not always) carried out; yet it took
whole months for a request made in a letter from Salamanca
or Madrid to reach London, to be there acceded to, and
then to take effect by a publication of the <cite>Gazette</cite>. The
power to punish or reward with promptness was never
granted; there was always a long delay. And both
punishment and reward lose much of their salutary effect
when there is an interval of months between the act and its
consequence. Napoleon had a unique advantage in being
at once the commander-in-chief and the dispenser of
favours and chastisement; with him there was no time lost
in lengthy reference to a home government.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII" class="vspace">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="subhead">THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ARMY: HEADQUARTERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Having dealt with the greater personalities among Wellington’s
lieutenants, it remains that we should speak of the
organization by which his army was set in motion.</p>

<p>Some great commanders have trusted much to their
staff, and have kept their ablest subordinates about their
person. This was pre-eminently not the case with Wellington:
he was as averse to providing himself with a regular
chief-of-the-staff, as he was to allowing a formal second-in-command
to accompany his army. The duties which
would, according to modern ideas, fall to the chief-of-the-staff,
were by him divided between three officers, one of
whom was of quite junior standing, and only one of whom
held a higher rank than that of colonel. These officers were
the Military Secretary, the Quartermaster-General, and the
Adjutant-General.</p>

<p>The Military Secretary was merely responsible for the
correct drawing out, and the transmission to the proper
person or department, of the correspondence of the commander-in-chief.
The post was held from April 27, 1809,
to September 19, 1810, by Lieutenant-Colonel Bathurst, of
the 60th. On the last-named date he went home on leave,
and Captain Lord Fitzroy Somerset was given the status
of acting-secretary, and confirmed as actual secretary three
months later on January 1, 1811. This officer, better
remembered by his later title as the Lord Raglan of the
Crimean War, held the office till the end of the war—by
which time he had reached the rank of colonel. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
one of Wellington’s best-trusted subordinates, and his
personal friend, but being very young, and junior in rank
to all heads of departments, he was in no sense an appreciable
factor in Wellington’s conduct of the war. In fact, he was
nothing more than his title of secretary indicated, and was
in no way responsible for organization, or entitled to offer
advice.</p>

<p>Much more important were the two great heads of
departments, the Quartermaster-General and Adjutant-General.
The former was charged with all matters relating
to the embarkation or disembarkation, the equipment,
quartering, halting, encamping, and route-marching of the
various units of the army. He had to convey to all generals
in command of them the orders of the general-in-chief,
and for this purpose had under his control a number of
officers bearing the clumsy titles of assistant-quartermaster-generals,
and deputy-assistant-quartermaster-generals. Of
the former there were five, of the latter seven, when the
army was first organized in April, 1809, but their numbers
were continually increasing all through the war, for each unit
had an assistant-quartermaster-general and a deputy-assistant-quartermaster-general
attached to it, and as the
divisions and brigades grew in number, so did the officers
of the Quartermaster-General’s department told off to them.
There was also a parallel growth in the number of those who
remained at headquarters, directly attached to their chief.</p>

<p>There is an interesting minute by Wellington, laying
down the relations between the divisional generals and the
staff-officers of the department: he points out that, though
the latter are the organs of headquarters in dealing with
divisions, yet they are under the command of the divisional
general: and the responsibility both for the orders given
through them being carried out, and for their acts in
general, lies with the division-commander. “Every staff
officer,” he says, “must be considered as acting under the
direct orders and superintendence of the superior officer
for whose assistance he is employed, and who is responsible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
for his acts. To consider the relative situation of the
general officer and the staff officer in any other light, would
tend to alter the nature of the Service, and, in fact, might
give the command of the troops to a subaltern staff officer
instead of to their general officer.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Quartermaster-General</div>

<p>The officers of the Quartermaster-General’s department,
besides their duties with regard to the moving of the army,
or the detachments of it, had often to undertake independent
work at a distance from headquarters, and sometimes
remote from the theatre of war. It was they who made
topographical surveys, reports on roads and bridges, and
on the resources of districts through which the army might
have to move in the near or distant future. There was
issued early in 1810 a little manual called <cite>Instructions for
the officers in the department of the Quartermaster-General</cite>
which was given to all its members: it contains a selection
of orders and forms, relating to every possible duty with
which its recipients might be entrusted. The most interesting
section is that on topographical surveys, to which there
is annexed a model report of the road from Truxillo to
Merida, containing notes on everything which a staff officer
ought to notice,—positions, defiles, size of villages, character
of sections of the road, amount of corn-land as opposed
to pasture or waste, warnings as to unhealthy spots, notes
as to the depth of rivers and the practicability of fords, etc.</p>

<p>So far as I can ascertain, Wellington had only two
Quartermaster-Generals during the whole of the long period
of his supreme command. Colonel George Murray of the
3rd Guards held the post from April, 1809, to May 28,
1812: he must be carefully distinguished from two other
Murrays, who sometimes turn up in the dispatches. One
is Major-General John Murray, who commanded a brigade
in the Oporto campaign, went home because he considered
that Beresford had been unjustly promoted over his head,
and came out later to the Peninsula on the Catalan side,
where he was responsible for the mismanaged operations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
about Tarragona. The other is John Murray, the Commissary-General.
When Wellington sometimes uses such
a phrase in his dispatches as “Murray knows this,” or “see
that Murray is informed,” it is often most difficult to be sure
which of the three men is meant. Early in 1811 Colonel
George Murray became a major-general, and in the following
May he appears to have gone home. He was replaced as
Quartermaster-General by Colonel James Gordon—who,
again, must not be confused with Colonel Sir Alexander
Gordon, who was one of Wellington’s senior aides-de-camp,
and was killed at Waterloo. This is another of the confusions
between homonyms which often give trouble. If a
diarist speaks of “Colonel Gordon” we have to find which
of the two is meant. James Gordon, having acted as
quartermaster-general from May, 1811, to January, 1813,
went home, and George Murray, returning early in that
year, worked out the remaining fifteen months of the war
in his old position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Adjutant-General</div>

<p>Parallel with the Quartermaster-General was the other
great departmental chief at headquarters, the Adjutant-General,
whose sphere of activity was disciplinary and
statistical. He was charged with all the detail of duties
to be distributed, with the collecting and compiling for the
use of the commander-in-chief of all returns of men and
horses in “morning states,” etc., with the supreme supervision
of the discipline of the army, and with much official
correspondence that did not pass to the Military Secretary.
Roughly speaking, the internal condition of the troops fell
to his share, while their movement belonged to the Quartermaster-General.
He had to aid him on the first organization
of the army in 1809, eight assistant-adjutant-generals and six
deputy-assistant-adjutant-generals, but (as in the Quartermaster-General’s
department) the number of subordinates
mounted up, as the war went on, and new units were from
time to time created, since an assistant-adjutant-general
was attached to each division.</p>

<p>The first holder of the office was Major-General the Hon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
Charles Stewart (afterwards Lord Londonderry, the earliest
historian of the Peninsular War), who was discharging its
functions from April, 1809, till April, 1813, just four years.
He was then sent on a diplomatic mission to Berlin, and
Wellington offered the post to his own brother-in-law,
Major-General Edward Pakenham, who, while in charge of
the 3rd division, had made the decisive charge at Salamanca.
Pakenham was adjutant-general for the last year of the
war, April, 1813, to April, 1814, and went straight out from
Bordeaux to command the unlucky New Orleans expedition,
in which he lost his life.</p>

<p>It will be noted that Wellington had actually only two
Quartermaster-Generals and two Adjutant-Generals under
him during the five years of his Peninsular command—a
sufficient proof that when he had found his man he stuck
to him. Charles Stewart, who served him so long, was a
person of some political importance, as the brother and
confidant of Lord Castlereagh. In the early part of his
tenure of office he seems sometimes to have made suggestions
to his chief, but met little encouragement, for Wellington
loved his own way, and was not to be influenced even by his
own highest staff officers.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> He did not wish to have a
Gneisenau or a Moltke at his side: he only wanted zealous
and competent chief clerks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minor Heads of Departments</div>

<p>Attached to headquarters in addition to the three great
functionaries already named, were the heads of several other
departments of great importance. These <span class="locked">were—</span></p>

<p>(1) The general officer commanding the Royal Artillery,
who had a general supervisory charge of the batteries
attached to the divisions, and a more specific control of
the battering-train and reserve artillery, when these came
into existence in 1811, as well as of the ammunition columns.
The first artillery chief was Brigadier-General E. Howarth,
who arrived at Lisbon in 1809, about the same time as
Wellington himself. He was promoted major-general in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
1811, and went home that year. The command then went
through a rapid succession of hands. Howarth was followed
by Major-General Borthwick, who apparently crossed
Wellington, and went home in March, 1812, after less than
a year’s tenure of the post. Borthwick was succeeded by
Colonel H. Framingham, and he within a few months by
Colonel G. B. Fisher, who (like Borthwick) fell out with
the commander-in-chief, and applied for leave to go home
ere 1813 was six months old. Wellington then appointed
Colonel Alexander Dickson to the command late in May.
This officer had been for the last two years in charge of the
Portuguese artillery under Beresford. He had given such
satisfaction at Rodrigo and Badajoz that Wellington re-transferred
him to the British service, and finished the
campaign of 1814 with Dickson in chief charge of this
branch.</p>

<p>(2) After the artillery chief we encounter as a prominent
figure at headquarters the commanding officer of Royal
Engineers. He had the superintending duty over his own
staff and the engineer officers attached to the divisions, and
control over the “Royal Military Artificers,” as the rank
and file of the scientific corps were named till 1812, when they
changed their title to Royal Sappers and Miners.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> The
commanding engineer had also charge over the engineers’
park and the pontoon train. The officer who held this post
from 1809 till he was killed at St. Sebastian in September,
1813, was Colonel Richard Fletcher, who has left a fame
behind him as the designer of the Lines of Torres Vedras.
On his death the command fell to Lieut.-Colonel Elphinstone,
who was responsible for the celebrated bridge of boats
across the mouth of the Adour which made the siege of
Bayonne possible in 1814.</p>

<p>(3, 4) At headquarters were also to be found the officers
commanding the Staff Corps Cavalry, and the Corps of
Guides. The former, a small unit of some 200 men, created
in 1812, discharged the police duties of the army, and were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
worked along with the Provost Marshal. They were occasionally
also employed as orderlies, and in other confidential
positions.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> The Guides were a small body also, some
150 or 200 strong, partly British, partly Portuguese, the
latter preponderating. They were detached in twos or
threes, to act as interpreters as well as guides to bodies of
troops moving in country not known to them. For this
reason they had to be bilingual, either English knowing
some Portuguese, or Portuguese knowing some English, as
they had always to be acting as intermediaries between the
army and the peasantry, in making inquiries about roads,
supplies, etc. The officer commanding the Guides had also
the charge of the post office, and the transmission of letters
to and from the front.</p>

<p>(5) The Provost Marshal was also attached to headquarters:
he had charge of all prisoners to be tried by general
court-martial, of deserters, and prisoners of war. He had
powers of jurisdiction on offenders caught red-handed, but
as Wellington remarks, “Whatever may be the crime of
which a soldier is guilty, the Provost Marshal has not the
power of inflicting summary punishment for it, unless he
should see him in the act of committing it.”<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> Men
arrested on evidence only, had to be tried by court-martials.
For the better management of these last, Wellington added a
Judge-Advocate-General to his staff in 1812, whose duty
was to see that trials were conducted with proper forms and
due appreciation of the validity of evidence—in which the
commander-in-chief considered that they had often failed.
Mr. Francis Larpent, who has left an interesting diary of
his duties and his personal adventures, discharged the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
function of this office from his arrival late in 1812 down to
the end of the war.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>As to aides-de-camp, Wellington kept a very limited
number of them—he only employed some twenty in the
course of the war, and not more than eight or ten at once.
They were nearly all young men of the great political
families,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> nearly half of them were Guards’ officers, and
the rest mostly belonged to the cavalry. The Prince of
Orange served among them in 1811–12. None of them,
save Lord Fitzroy Somerset (Lord Raglan) and Colonel
Cadogan, came to any very great military position or
reputation.</p>

<p>So much for the military side of headquarters. There
were also attached to it seven civil departments, small and
great, of which it may be well to give a list. On one or
two of these we shall have to speak at some length in later
chapters—notably the Commissariat and the Medical
department. They consisted <span class="locked">of—</span></p>

<p>(1) The Medical Department under an Inspector of
Hospitals, who was in general charge of the physicians,
surgeons, assistants, etc., attached to the various units of
the army. There is an excellent account of the management
of this department, and all its difficulties, in the <cite>Autobiography</cite>
of Sir James McGrigor, chief of the Medical Staff
in 1812–13–14. His predecessor since Wellington’s first
landing in 1809 was Dr. Frank, who was invalided in the
autumn of 1811.</p>

<p>(2) The Purveyor’s Department was independent of the
medical, though it might well have been attached to it:
the establishment consisted of a Purveyor to the Forces,
with deputies and assistants, who had charge of the hospitals
and all the material and details required for them—from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
the drugs for the sick to the burial expenses of the
dead.</p>

<p>(3) The Paymaster-General, with his assistants, was
responsible for the transmission of the money received to
the regimental paymasters of the various units. He was a
much-worried man, generally from three to six months in
arrears with his specie, from no fault of his own, but from
the immense difficulty of obtaining the hard dollars, doubloons,
and “cruzados novos,” which alone had currency in
the Peninsula till a late period in the war. It was useless
to issue English money to the troops, for the natives would
not accept crowns and guineas, and refused even to look at
the one-pound notes which were almost the sole circulating
medium in Great Britain during this period. It was only
in a late year of the war that the gold guinea was at last
tariffed by the Spanish and Portuguese Governments, and
became readily current.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Commissariat</div>

<p>(4) Most important of all the Civil Departments was
the Commissariat, under the Commissary-General, who had
under him Deputy-Commissary-Generals, Assistant and
Deputy-Assistant-Commissaries, Commissariat Clerks, and
many other subordinates. The department was divided
into two branches, stores and accounts. The post of
Commissary-General was successively held by John Murray
(already mentioned above) from 1809 to June, 1810, by
Kennedy from June, 1810, to September, 1811, and by
Bisset from September, 1811, onward. An assistant commissary
was attached to each brigade of infantry and
each regiment of cavalry, but a single official had to attend
to the needs of the whole of the artillery with the army,
and another to the needs of headquarters.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>The whole future of the army in 1809 depended on
whether the Commissariat Department would be able to
rise to the height of its duties. It was absolutely necessary
that Wellington should be able to keep his army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
concentrated, if this small force of 20,000 or 30,000 men was
to be of any weight in the conduct of the war in the Peninsula.
The much-cursed and criticized Commissariat succeeded in
doing its duty, and the length of time for which the British
army could keep concentrated was the envy of the French,
who, living on the country, were forced to disperse whenever
they had exhausted the resources of the particular region
in which they were massed. In a way this fact was the
key to the whole war. Wellington’s salvation lay in the
fact that he could hold his entire army together, while his
adversaries could not. On this advantage he relied again
and again: his whole strategy depended upon it. How
the Commissariat worked we shall show in a later chapter.</p>

<p>(5) The Storekeeper-General had charge of the field
equipments, tents, and heavy baggage of the army. Often
the heavy baggage was left at Lisbon, and all through
1809–10–11 no tents were taken to the front. It was only
in the Vittoria and South-French campaigns that the whole
army regularly carried them. In the days when the
transport trains were not fully organized, it was necessary
to leave even valuable impedimenta behind.</p>

<p>(6) To the Controller of Army Accounts all departments,
save the Commissariat, rendered their statistics of money
received and spent.</p>

<p>(7) Last, we may name the Press, for a travelling Press
and a small staff of military printers accompanied the
headquarters when possible, and printed general orders,
and other documents and forms, of which many copies
were required. I have seen much of its work at the Record
Office,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> but have never come across an account of its organization,
or of any anecdotes of its wandering life, in which it
must have passed through many vicissitudes. The press
was under the general supervision of the Adjutant-General.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ARMY: BRIGADES AND DIVISIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It will probably surprise some readers to learn that Sir
Arthur Wellesley fought out the first campaign in which
he held supreme command, that of Oporto in May, 1809,
with no higher organized unit than the brigade. But this
is the fact: the 18,000 infantry of which he could dispose
were distributed into eight brigades of two or three battalions
each, varying in strength from 1400 up to 2500 bayonets.
But Wellesley was not so belated, in failing to form divisions,
as might be thought. They were still rather an abnormal
than a usual unit for a British army: indeed, in the large
majority of the expeditions in which Great Britain had
been engaged since 1793, the numbers were so small that
no unit above the brigade had been necessary. But it is
notable that neither in the Duke of York’s first expedition
to the Netherlands in 1793–94, nor in his second in 1799,
nor in Abercrombie’s Egyptian Campaign of 1801 had
divisions been formed—though in each of these cases a
very large force had been assembled. When several
brigades acted together, not under the immediate eye of
the commander-in-chief, the senior brigadier present took
temporary charge of the assemblage. In the Low Countries
York generally speaks of his army as being divided into
“columns” of two or three brigades each,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> but there was no
fixity in the arrangement. Abercrombie, on the other hand,
in the last dispatch which he wrote before his victory and
death at Alexandria, lays down the theoretical organization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
that the army is to be considered as being divided into
three “lines”—the first composed of three brigades, the
second and third of two each. If the <em>word</em> division is used
in any official documents of these campaigns, the term has
no technical military sense, but is used as a vague synonym
for a section or part of the army.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> Indeed, so far as I know,
the first British force during the great French War which
was formed into divisions, in the proper modern sense, was
the army which went on the Copenhagen Expedition of
1807, which was regularly distributed into four of such
units, each under a lieutenant-general, and each composed
of two, three, or four weak brigades, generally of only two
battalions. This was a force of some 26,000 men.</p>

<p>The original Peninsular Army of 1808, which landed at
the mouth of the Mondego, and won the battle of Vimeiro,
was not far, therefore, from being the first British force
organized in divisions. It may be noted that they were
rather theoretical than real, for several brigades had not
yet landed when Vimeiro was fought, and Wellesley, while
in temporary command, worked the incomplete army on a
brigade system: no trace whatever of the use of the
divisions as real units will be found in that battle. Indeed,
even the theoretical composition of some of the brigades
differed from that actually seen in action. No genuine
divisions were formed in the Peninsula, till Sir John Moore
took command of the army from which its old chiefs, Dalrymple,
Burrand and Wellesley himself had been removed
and sent home. We must not, therefore, be surprised
to find that for three months after he landed at Lisbon in
April, 1809, Wellesley worked his 21,000 British troops in
detached brigades, only connected in a formal and temporary
way, under the senior brigadier, when two or more chanced
to form a marching or fighting unit.</p>

<p>But two other points concerning Wellesley’s Oporto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
campaign deserve notice. This was the first and only
occasion on which he tried the experiment of mixing British
and Portuguese regiments in the same brigade.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> To five of
the eight brigades forming his infantry a Portuguese
battalion was attached, picked as being one of the best of
the rather disorderly assembly which Beresford had collected
at Abrantes and Thomar. Though the Portuguese fought
not amiss during this short campaign, and are mentioned
with praise in Wellesley’s dispatches, yet the experiment
was not continued, evidently because it was found not to
work happily. The five Portuguese battalions were sent
back to Beresford not long after the fall of Oporto.</p>

<p>The other point to be noted in considering Wellesley’s
organization of his army in the Oporto campaign, is that
already he had begun the system of strengthening his
skirmishers by the addition to them of a rifle company per
brigade, all taken from the 5/60th. The importance of
this arrangement in the general scheme of his tactics has
been already explained in an earlier chapter.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>So much for Wellesley’s first organization of his army.
It did not endure for so much as three months, for on
June 18, 1809, a General Order, dated from the Adjutant-General’s
office at Abrantes, gave to the army the organization
in divisions, under which it was to win all its subsequent
victories. In the midst of some insignificant directions as
to forage and ammunition, appears the clause that “as
the weather now admits of the troops hutting, and they
can move together in large bodies, brigades can be formed
into divisions, as follows.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Original Four Divisions</div>

<p>The original disposition was for four divisions only, of
which the first consisted of four brigades, the other three
of two brigades each. All the battalions in them were in
the British service, no Portuguese being included. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
four line battalions of the King’s German Legion were
arranged first as one, and then as two brigades of the First
Division. Of the ten brigades into which the infantry of
the army were now divided, seven had two battalions only,
the other three three battalions each. The cavalry, which
had recently been increased by the arrival of two regiments
from England, was organized as a division of three brigades
of two regiments each. The artillery, of which only five
field batteries (or “companies” as they were then called)
had reached the front, was not yet told off to the individual
divisions in a permanent fashion, though certain units are
generally found acting with the same division.</p>

<p>As to the command of the divisions, Wellington contemplated
that each should ultimately be in the charge of
a lieutenant-general; but as he had only three officers of
such rank at his disposition—Hill, Sherbrooke, and the
cavalry commander Payne—the General Order directs that
“the senior general officers of brigades will respectively
take the command of the division in which their brigades
are placed, till other lieutenant-generals shall join the army.”
This placed two brigadiers, McKenzie and A. Campbell,
in temporary charge of the 3rd and 4th divisions, Sherbrooke
taking the 1st, and Hill the 2nd. Sherbrooke went home
before a year was out, but Hill was to remain in command
of the 2nd division throughout the war, except during the
short periods when he was on leave. But during his last
three years in the Peninsula, when he was practically acting
as commander of an army corps, the 2nd division was, in
fact, under the leadership of William Stewart as his substitute.
The only modification caused in internal organization
by the creation of the new divisions was that an
assistant-adjutant-general, and quartermaster-general, and a
provost-marshal were attached to each of them, and that
the brigadiers acting as division-commanders were authorized
to take on some extra aides-de-camp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rearrangements after Talavera</div>

<p>It was with this organization that Wellington’s army
went through the Talavera campaign, and the retreat to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
the Guadiana which terminated it. The whole force was
British, no single Portuguese battalion accompanying it.
The troops of that nation were being employed under
Beresford during this summer, to cover the frontier of
Beira, between the Douro and the Tagus. Long before
the campaign was over, more British reinforcements had
begun to arrive at Lisbon, and had been pushed forward
some distance into the interior. One brigade, that composed
of the three light battalions,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> under Robert Craufurd,
afterwards to be famous in Peninsular annals as the nucleus
of the “Light Division,” got to the front after a tremendous
march—somewhat exaggerated by Napier and by tradition—only
a day after the battle of Talavera. Wellesley incorporated
it for a movement in the 3rd division, in which it
finished the campaign. There were seven other battalions<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>
which did not get so far forward, and ultimately joined
Beresford’s Portuguese on the frontier of Spain. In
September Wellington drew down these troops to join him
in Estremadura, and made from them a third brigade
each for his 2nd and 4th Divisions. But there was about
this time a shifting about of battalions from division to
division, which it would be tedious to give in detail. The
net result was that at the end of 1809 Wellington had four
much stronger divisions than he had possessed in the
summer, the 1st counting nine battalions instead of its old
eight, the 2nd ten instead of six, the 3rd still six, but the
4th eight instead of five.</p>

<p>The early months of 1810 were spent by Wellington in
an expectant attitude, behind the Portuguese frontier, as
he waited for the inevitable French invasion under Masséna,
so long announced and so long delayed. In this time of
long-deferred anxiety, while the Lines of Torres Vedras were
being busily urged towards completion, Wellington carried
out some most important changes in the organization of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
his army, which made it (except in the matter of mere
numbers) exactly what it was to remain till the end of the
war.</p>

<p>The most notable of these changes was that he made
up his mind to revert to his old plan of April, 1809, for
mixing the Portuguese and British troops. It took a new
form, however: instead of placing battalions of each
nationality side by side in his brigades, he attached a
Portuguese brigade of four or five battalions to most of
his British divisions, as a distinct unit. This system was
started with the 3rd and 4th Divisions on Feb. 22, 1810. A
complete Portuguese brigade consisted of two line regiments
(each of two battalions) and one caçador or rifle battalion.
The latter was always employed for the brigade’s skirmishing
work; when joined by the four light companies of the line
battalions, it gave a very heavy proportion of light troops
to the unit. This Wellington considered necessary, because
of the untried quality of the whole Portuguese Army,
which had not yet taken a serious part in any general
action. In the autumn they justified Wellington’s confidence
in them at the battle of Bussaco, where all of them,
and especially the two caçador battalions attached to the
Light Division, played a most creditable part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Light Division</div>

<p>The second great innovation made in the spring of
1810 was the creation of the celebrated Light Division,
which came into existence on Feb. 22, 1810; it was formed
by taking Robert Craufurd’s brigade, the 1/43rd, 1/52nd,
and 1/95th out of the 3rd division, and adding to them the
above-mentioned two Portuguese caçador battalions. Wellington’s
design was to produce for the whole army, by the
institution of this new unit, what he had already done for
the individual brigades when he added their rifle companies
to them in April, 1809. The Light Division was to be, as
it were, the protective screen for the whole army,—its
strategical skirmishing line, thrown out far in front of the
rest of the host, to keep off the French till the actual moment
of battle, and to hide the dispositions of the main body.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
At the head of this small corps of picked light troops was
placed Robert Craufurd, whom Wellington rightly considered
his best officer for outpost and reconnaissance work.
How well this trusted subordinate discharged the duty laid
upon him has been told in the chapter dealing with his
character and exploits. All through the war Wellington
used the Light Division as his screen, for his advanced guard
when he was moving to the front, for his rearguard when
he was on the retreat, and he was never betrayed by it,
even after Craufurd’s death had left its conduct in the
hands of chiefs who were not always men of special ability.</p>

<p>After the creation of the Light Division, Wellington
had five instead of four divisions, and another was added
to them in the summer of 1810, when in August he created
the 5th Division, so long commanded by General Leith.
This was formed by adding to a British brigade, newly
arrived from England,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> two of the hitherto unattached
Portuguese brigades. A second British brigade was provided
in October for Leith, from troops newly come from
Cadiz.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> These having come to hand, the 5th Division
dropped one of its Portuguese brigades, and became a unit
of the normal shape and size, two-thirds British, one-third
Portuguese. It did not, however, receive its caçador
battalion (drawn from the Lusitanian Legion) till 1811.</p>

<p>During the campaign of Bussaco, therefore, Wellington
had six divisions—the old ones numbered 1st to 4th, the
Light Division, and the newly-created 5th. In addition to
the Portuguese brigades which had now been absorbed into
the divisions, there remained six more brigades of that
nation which were still unattached. Of these two, under the
Brigadiers Archibald Campbell and Fonseca, were formed
into a division under General Hamilton, which always
marched with Hill’s 2nd Division, but was never formally
made part of it. But since Hamilton invariably moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
along with Hill, this pair of units, with their ten British and
eight Portuguese battalions, practically formed a double
division, or a small army corps, if a term which Wellington
never used in the Peninsula may be applied to it.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> There
remained four more independent Portuguese brigades,
those of Pack, Alex. Campbell, Coleman, and Bradford.
By the next year these were reduced to two, as one brigade
was withdrawn to serve with the new British 7th division,
and another with the 2nd. The surviving units continued as
unattached brigades till the end of the war, under a series
of commanding officers, whose succession is sometimes hard
to follow.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> They often accompanied the main army, but
were sometimes separated from it for special duties, when
some force less than a division was wanted, as a detachment
for a subsidiary operation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Creation of the 6th and 7th Divisions</div>

<p>The completion of the Peninsular Army in its final
shape, which was not again to be varied, took place during
its stay by the Lines of Torres Vedras, in the winter of
1810–11. It was then that the two junior divisions were
created, the 6th in October, the 7th early in March. Their
appearance in the field was, of course, due to the arrival of
a considerable number of fresh battalions from England
during the autumn and winter. But Wellington did not
take all the new-comers and build up fresh divisions from
them. The 6th Division was made by taking an old brigade
(Archibald Campbell’s) from the 4th Division, and uniting
it to the extra Portuguese brigade of the 5th Division.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a>
The second British brigade of the 6th division was provided
some months later from newly-arrived troops from England.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
The 4th Division was compensated for the brigade it had
given to the 6th by taking over a brigade (Pakenham’s)
from the 1st Division—while the 1st Division, to replace this
last unit, received three battalions<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> which had just come
out from home.</p>

<p>This was a complicated shift and transfer, intended to
secure a level quality in the divisions by the mixture of
recently arrived and veteran battalions. But in organizing
his last creation, the 7th Division, Wellington was prevented
by circumstances from carrying out the same wise plan.
Much belated in their arrival at Lisbon by contrary winds,
the last batch of reinforcements sent to him for the campaign
of 1811, landed when the main army was already in
pursuit of Masséna, who had just started on his retreat
from Santarem. Wellington was forced to keep them
together, since he had no time to distribute them when the
troops were all on the move. The 7th division was at first
very weak, containing only one brigade in British pay,
consisting of two English and two foreign corps,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> and one
Portuguese brigade (Coleman). Two more foreign corps
belonging to the German Legion<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> formed the second brigade
of the 7th Division, but did not join it till the summer,
being distracted meanwhile to another field of operations.</p>

<p>The 7th Division was for some time looked on as the
“ugly duckling,” or backward child of the army. Having
only two British to four foreign battalions, it was sometimes
called “the Mongrels;” its first début in action at Fuentes
de Oñoro was not a very happy one, as it was the outlying
flank force that was turned and partly cut up by French
cavalry. After this it was never seriously engaged in
battle for more than a year. Moreover, its foreigners
earned a bad reputation for their habit of desertion—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
habit not altogether unnatural, for they had been largely
recruited from the pontoons and prison-camps in England.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>
Hence a cruel joke in the list of divisional nicknames
given by several Peninsular diarists. The sobriquets run:
Light Division, <em>The</em> Division; no doubt the title given
to it by its own proud members. First Division: “The
Gentlemen’s Sons,” because it contained one, and afterwards
two, brigades of the Foot Guards. The Second
Division is called “the Observing Division,” because it was
so often detached as a containing force against Soult, on the
side of Estremadura and Andalusia, while the main body
was more actively engaged on the side of Leon. So much
was this its duty that it was only present at one general
action, Albuera, between the autumn of 1810 and the summer
of 1813. There were some brilliant episodes between those
dates, such as the surprise of Arroyo dos Molinos, and
the storming of the forts at Almaraz. The 3rd Division was
called “the Fighting Division,” its fiery leader, Picton,
having led it into the forefront of the battle both at Bussaco
and Fuentes de Oñoro, not to speak of smaller fights like
Redinha or El Bodon; it had also done the hardest of
work at the storms of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz. The
4th Division was called the “Supporting Division;” I suppose
because it was sent off to support the 2nd in Estremadura,
and most effectually discharged that duty at Albuera.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> The
5th division was called “the Pioneers,” a name whose
source I cannot explain: possibly it refers to some road-making
work done in 1810. The 6th was the “Marching
Division,” mainly, I believe, so-called because down to
Salamanca it was accompanying all Wellington’s great
movements from north to south and south to north, yet
never had the good fortune to get into the thick of the
battle. At Salamanca, however, it had as much fighting
as any man could crave. The note to the 7th Division,
however, is very malicious, being “We have <em>heard</em> that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
there is a Seventh Division, but we have never <em>seen</em> it.”
The fact is, that after its mishap at Fuentes, and some
unsuccessful siege work at the second leaguer of Badajoz,
this unit was very little engaged for two years. In 1813,
however, it was gloriously prominent in the battles of the
Pyrenees, and the dash at the French line, made by Barns’s
brigade, was called by Wellington about the best and most
effective attack that he had ever seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rearrangement of Units</div>

<p>After the creation of the 7th Division in March, 1811,
Wellington never again organized a new divisional unit.
He received, of course, a great number of new battalions
during the years 1811–12–13, but contented himself with
adding them in ones or twos to existing brigades, or at
most gave two or three of them as a fresh brigade to one of
the old divisions. The former practice was the more usual:
the only instances of the latter that I recall being that in
1812 the 1st Division got a second Guards brigade, and in
1813 a new line brigade (Lord Aylmer’s) from reinforcements
that had just come out. The increase of the total number
of battalions at the front was not so great as might have
been expected, because from time to time corps that had
got thinned down almost to the point of extinction, were
sent back to England to be recruited and reorganized. The
number of British battalions (including the King’s German
Legion and two other foreign corps) with Wellington’s field
army in March, 1811, was fifty-eight; in March, 1814, it was
no more than sixty-five, a gain of only seven units. There
had been a considerable exchange of service between the 1st
and 2nd battalion of regiments—in several cases when the
2nd battalion had been the original unit in the Peninsular
Army, it went home when the first battalion came out,
returning as a mere <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cadre</i> of officers and sergeants, after
turning over its serviceable rank and file to the newly-arrived
sister unit.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
There was only two more considerable rearrangements of
the internal organization of a division. One took place in
May, 1811, owing to the fearful losses suffered by the
2nd Division at Albuera. Of the seven battalions forming
the brigades of Colborne and Hoghton, which had been so
dreadfully mauled in holding the all-important heights,
two were sent home, and the four others shrank into a
single brigade. To fill the place of the vanished unit a
whole brigade (Howard’s) was transferred from the 1st to
the 2nd Division, and became part of it for the rest of the
war. There was also a shifting about of two brigades
from one unit to another during the winter of 1812–13,
after the Burgos retreat.</p>

<p>The normal divisional organization, however, remained
unchanged from 1811 onwards, viz. with three exceptions,
each division for the remaining three years of the war consisted
of two British brigades and one Portuguese, the
former having usually three battalions each, and the latter
five. This rule worked for the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th
divisions. The Light Division, smaller than the rest, had
only three (or three and a half) British battalions, and two
of Portuguese caçadores. The 1st Division alone had no
Portuguese attached, but one of its three (after 1813 <em>four</em>)
brigades was foreign, consisting of the line battalions of the
King’s German Legion. The 2nd Division (as explained
above) had three British brigades and no Portuguese, but
to it was attached Hamilton’s (and in 1812–14 Ashworth’s)
Portuguese, so that it did not vary from the normal
arrangement so much as the 1st Division.</p>

<p>It would not be quite accurate to say that a British
brigade always had precisely three battalions. Several had
four, one five, a few appeared with only two, but Wellington
generally made these last up to the three-battalion total
as soon as he was able, save in two cases. In the Guards
brigades of the 1st Division the two battalions were always
so strong that between them they gave 1800 or 2000
bayonets at the beginning of a campaign—which was as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
much as most three-battalion brigades produced. Moreover,
there was an objection to brigading together units of
the Guards and of the line. In the Light Division the
1/43rd and 1/52nd were also very strong and well recruited:
each formed the nucleus of a small brigade, of which the
rest was composed of a Portuguese caçador battalion and
a certain number (often six) companies of the 95th Rifles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Anglo-Portuguese Division</div>

<p>Roughly speaking, then, an Anglo-Portuguese division
usually amounted to something under 6000 men, save the
Light Division, which numbered under 4000, and the
1st Division, which in 1810, and again in 1813, had four
brigades, and over 7000 men. Of the 5500 or 5800 men in
one of the normal divisions about 3500 were British and
2000 (or a little more) Portuguese. The 2nd Division,
however, was a double-unit, with 5500 British, and attached
to it 6500 of Hamilton’s and Ashworth’s Portuguese.</p>

<p>The mixture of nationalities in the divisions, normal
with the infantry, was nearly unknown in the cavalry arm.
The very few Portuguese regiments which took the field—never
more than seven, I believe—often four only—were
normally kept separate. Wellington, for the first three years
of the war, had so few cavalry regiments of either nation
that there was no possibility of dividing them into divisions.
In 1809, as has been already stated,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> there were only in the
Peninsula six British cavalry regiments, divided into three
weak brigades. Only one more corps joined them in 1810,
and in the spring campaigns of 1811, when he had left three
regiments with Beresford in the south, he had only four to
take with him for the pursuit of Masséna and the battle of
Fuentes de Oñoro—a miserable provision—1500 sabres for
an army of over 30,000 men, about a fourth of the proper
proportion in those days.</p>

<p>It was not till later in 1811 that Wellington got cavalry
reinforcements which more than doubled his mounted
strength, bringing him up to fifteen regiments of British
and German horse. He did then at last divide them into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
two divisions, one of eleven regiments, which followed his
main army, the other of four regiments only, which he left
with Hill in Estremadura. But no Portuguese regiments
were put into either—though he took one brigade with
himself (D’Urban’s) for the Salamanca campaign, and left
two brigades (or four regiments) with the southern force
(those of Otway and Madden).</p>

<p>But the organization in two cavalry divisions was
dropped in the spring of 1813—Wellington had had sickening
experience of the incapacity of General Erskine, who
commanded the small second division, and, Erskine being
now dead, for the rest of the war all the seven cavalry
brigades were theoretically again made into one division,
under Wellington’s chosen cavalry leader, Sir Stapleton
Cotton. As a matter of fact, Cotton was not allowed any
independent command of them, and the brigades were
moved in twos and threes under the direct orders of the
commander-in-chief. Wellington never used his cavalry
in mass for any great separate manœuvre. He employed
them for scouting, for covering his front, and for protecting
his flanks, sometimes (but rarely and in small units) for a
blow in battle, such as that which Le Marchant’s heavy
dragoons gave at Salamanca, or Bock’s Germans at Garcia
Hernandez on the following day. But of this we have
already spoken when dealing with the general character
of Wellington’s tactics.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distribution of Batteries</div>

<p>The rule of the combination of British and Portuguese
units which prevailed in the infantry, though not in the
cavalry, was to be found in the artillery also. In 1810,
when Wellington drafted a Portuguese brigade of foot
into each of his divisions, he also attached to several of
them batteries of Portuguese artillery. So small was his
allowance of British gunners, that in 1811, when he had
created his two last infantry divisions, he would not have
been able to provide one field battery for each of his eight
units, unless he had drawn largely for help on his allies.
At the time of Fuentes de Oñoro and Albuera there were in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
the field only three British horse artillery batteries (attached
to the cavalry and the Light Division) and five British field
batteries attached to infantry divisions. The 3rd and 7th
Divisions had only Portuguese guns allotted to them. But
by utilizing the very efficient artillery of the allied nation,
to the extent of eight units, Wellington was able to put
thirteen field batteries in line, which enabled him to provide
the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and Hamilton’s Portuguese divisions
with two batteries apiece, the 1st, 4th, and 7th with one
each. The two nations were worked as successfully in
unison in the artillery as in the infantry organization.</p>

<p>Owing to the arrival of new batteries from home Wellington
was able, in 1812, not only to allot one or two field
batteries to every division except the Light (which kept its
old horse artillery troop, that of Major Ross), but to collect
a small reserve which belonged to the whole army and not
to any particular division. In 1813–14 he was stronger
still, though the mass of guns of which he could dispose
was never so powerful in proportion to his whole army as
that which Napoleon habitually employed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_X" class="vspace">CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="subhead">THE ORGANIZATION OF THE ARMY: THE REGIMENTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the year 1809, when Wellington assumed command in
Portugal, the infantry of the British Army consisted of
3 regiments of Foot Guards and 103 regiments of the line,
beside 10 battalions of the King’s German Legion, the 8
West India regiments, the 8 Veteran Battalions, and some
ten more miscellaneous foreign and colonial corps. Of the
103 regiments of the line the majority, 61, had 2 battalions.
Of the remainder one (the 60th or Royal Americans) had 7
battalions, one (the 1st Royal Scots) 4, three (the 14th,
27th, and 95th) 3 each, while the remaining 37 were
single-battalion regiments.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> As the 1st Foot Guards had
3 battalions, and the Coldstream and Scots Fusiliers 2 each,
the total number of British battalions embodied was 186.</p>

<p>The reason for the curious discrepancy between the
number of battalions in the various regiments was that
(putting aside the Guards, the Royal Scots, and the Royal
Americans, who had always more battalions than one, even
in the eighteenth century) the British Army at the time of
the rupture of the Peace of Amiens in 1803 had been composed
of single-battalion regiments. On the outbreak of
war fifty regiments in the British Isles and other home
stations were ordered to raise second battalions,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
little later the same directions were given to a few more.
Two corps (the 14th and 27th) succeeded in raising two fresh
battalions, as did also the Royal Scots, which was already
a double battalion corps. But few of the regiments serving
beyond seas were ordered to carry out the same expansion,
owing to their remoteness from recruiting centres; they
remained single-battalion regiments, save that the 35th,
47th, and 78th, though they were quartered respectively in
Malta, Bermuda, and India, provided themselves with a
second battalion. Seven new regiments raised in or after
1804 (these numbered 97 to 103) remained from the first to
the last single-battalion corps.</p>

<p>A considerable number of the corps which were on
foreign or colonial service in 1803–4 had returned to Great
Britain since that time. But they were never, save in a
very few cases, able to raise additional battalions, the
number of such created after 1805 being only eight<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> in all.
Hence the regiments from which Wellington’s Peninsular
Army was drawn must be divided with care into one-battalion
corps and those which owned more than one
battalion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Establishment of the Line</div>

<p>The Estimates presented to the House of Commons in
1809 show that there were several “establishments” of
varying strength for regiments in Great Britain and other
European stations. For corps absent in the East Indies
there was a wholly different set.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p>A regiment of two battalions, with both of them on
active service, stands on the higher establishment at either
2250 or 2031, or thereabouts. When the senior battalion
was sent on active service it was generally completed to
1000 rank and file, which, with sergeants, officers, and
musicians, should have made up a total of over 1100. Its
less effective men were drafted into the second battalion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
which, if the establishment was full (which was by no
means always the case), would have left somewhat over 900
for the second battalion. And, indeed, we find such figures
as 906, 929, 916, etc., given for the strength of several
second battalions whose senior sister-unit had gone overseas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Weakness of Second Battalions</div>

<p>But these 900 and odd men of all ranks now included
not only the weak and ineffective men of the second battalion,
but also those of the first. Therefore if a second
battalion was sent out to the war, it had to leave behind
a disproportionately large number of men unfit for active
service, and would be lucky if it sailed for Portugal with
700 bayonets. Many cases are on record where a far
smaller number disembarked at Lisbon or elsewhere.
More than 200 would often have to be left behind to form
the depôt, wherefore second battalions were usually much
weaker than first battalions when at the front.</p>

<p>For single-battalion regiments, such as the 2nd, 29th,
51st or 97th, we find very various “establishments” given
in the Army Estimates of 1809. They vary down from
1151 to 696; one or two exceptional corps are even smaller.
As a rule, it may be taken that the ideal would be to recruit
such a corps, when it was sent on active service, up to the
higher figure: but having to leave 200 men or so at home—the
inefficients who were drafted off for the depôt—it would
be lucky if it landed 800 in the Peninsula. And to keep
up the battalion the depôt could not always suffice; it was
full of unserviceable men, and could only send out recruits
newly gathered.</p>

<p>Single-battalion regiments not on active service are
those which are found with the smaller establishments—of
such figures as 716, 696, etc. Not being expected to take
the field, they have not been brought up to the higher
establishment, either by drafts from the militia or by
specially vigorous recruiting.</p>

<p>The three regiments of Foot Guards had much higher
establishments than any line battalion. The three battalions
of the 1st Guards mustered no less than 4619 of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
all ranks, the Coldstream and Scots Fusiliers each 2887.
Thus the former could easily send abroad two strong
battalions of 1100 or 1200 men apiece, and the two latter
one each, while leaving behind a battalion and a big depôt
on which to draw for recruits for the active service units.
Therefore a Guards battalion in the Peninsula seldom fell
under 800 men, and was sometimes up to 1000. The
Cadiz detachment of the Guards, which fought at Barrosa,
was made up from the home battalions as a sort of extra contribution.
It consisted of six companies of the 1st Guards,
two of the Coldstream, and three of the Scots Fusiliers.
They are sometimes called a brigade—for which they were
too small in reality—sometimes a provisional regiment.
Their total force was about 1200 or 1300 of all ranks.</p>

<p>With these figures before us, we begin to see why individual
battalions came and went in the Peninsular Army.
A regiment which had two battalions, one at home and one
in Portugal, was always able to keep up the strength of
the service unit by regular and copious drafts from the
home unit. Or if the original one serving in the Peninsula
was a <em>second</em> battalion, the first could be sent out to relieve
it. Second battalions were never sent out to replace first
battalions, it being always the rule that the senior unit had a
right to preference for active service. But occasionally both
battalions of a regiment were absent from Great Britain,
and in a few cases they were both in the Peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> When
this happened the second battalion was invariably sent
home after a time, discharging its effective rank and file
into the sister battalion, and returning to Great Britain as
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cadre</i> of officers and sergeants, with a few old, unserviceable,
or nearly time-expired rank and file.</p>

<p>Having laid down these general rules, we shall see how
it came to pass that of Wellington’s original army of 1809
some battalions stopped with him for the whole war, while
others were successively sent away and replaced by fresh
units.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
The greater part of the British Army which had been in
the Peninsula in 1808 went home from Corunna at the end
of Sir John Moore’s retreat. Of these units some never
came back at all to share in Wellington’s triumphs;<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>
others returned only in time to see the end of the war in
1812, 1813, and 1814.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> Only Craufurd’s three famous
light infantry battalions, the 1/43rd, 1/52nd, and 1/95th
came back, after an absence of no more than a few months,
in the summer of 1809.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Original Peninsular Regiments</div>

<p>The real nucleus of the permanent Peninsular Army was
composed, not of the regiments which had operated under
Moore, but of that small fragment of the original landing force
of 1808 which had not followed Moore to Salamanca, Sahagun,
and Corunna, but remained behind in the Peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a>
To this mere remnant of eleven battalions and one cavalry
regiment there were added the reinforcements which preceded
or accompanied Sir Arthur Wellesley when he came
to take up the command in April, 1809, which amounted to
twelve battalions more, with four regiments of cavalry.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a>
The whole, when first divided into brigades and organized
as an operating force at Coimbra on May 4, 1809, only
amounted to 23,000 men—a modest nucleus for the army
which was destined not only to save Portugal, but ultimately
to thrust out of Spain a body of invaders which at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
this moment amounted to over 200,000 men, and which in
1810–11 was brought up to 300,000, a figure which it
maintained till drafts began to be made upon it for the
Russian War in 1812.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>Moore’s host had been, as he himself wrote to Castlereagh
in a noteworthy dispatch, not so much <em>a</em> British army as
the <em>only</em> British army fit for the field. Since no more than
an infinitesimal fraction of this picked force was able to
return to the Peninsula at once, it followed that Wellesley’s
army of 1809 was composed, for its greater part, of troops
that had been considered of secondary quality, and less
fit for service than the battalions which had been put <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">hors
de combat</i> for a long space by the exhaustion which they had
suffered in the terrible retreat to Corunna. Excluding the
Guards and the King’s German Legion units, Wellesley’s
Field Army in July contained eighteen British battalions,
of which only six were first battalions of regiments of full
strength, two (the 29th and 97th) were single-battalion
corps, and the remaining ten were junior battalions, <i>i.e.</i>
were the usually depleted home-service units of regiments
which already had one battalion abroad, or of which the
first battalion had just returned from Corunna unfit for
immediate use.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> It was an army whose quality was
notably inferior to that of the force which had marched
into Spain under Moore six months before. And the
second battalions were invariably under strength, because
they had, until their unexpected embarkation for the
front, been engaged in supplying their sister units abroad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
with the necessary drafts for foreign service. Many of
them were woefully weak in numbers, showing, instead of
the theoretical 900 bayonets, such figures as 638, 680, 749,
776, which, after deducting sick and men on command,
meant under 600 for the field. Indeed, a few months
later, at Talavera,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> six of the second battalions and both
the single-battalion corps showed less than that number
present, all ranks included.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the fact that a British regiment, owing
to the difficulties of recruiting, in a time when men were
scarce and bounties high, could not as a rule provide drafts
to keep up to strength more than one battalion on active
service, we can already foresee the fates that were destined
to attend the battalions of Wellington’s original Peninsular
Army. Nearly all the second battalions in time were worn
down by the exhaustion of war to a figure so low that they
could no longer be worked as regular battalion units. When
they had reached this stage one of two things happened
to them. If their first battalions were available, being on
home service and fit for the field, they came out to the
Peninsula and replaced the depleted second battalions.
But if the first battalion of any corps was already abroad in
India or elsewhere, the Peninsular battalion was, during
the earlier years of the war, sent home to recruit, and its
regimental number disappeared from Wellington’s muster-rolls.
In the later years of the war this was not so regularly
done: for reasons which will be explained, several of the
veteran second battalions, which had survived at the front
till 1812, were retained with the army, but cut down to
four companies each, and worked together in pairs to make
a unit of serviceable size. Of the eight original second
battalions of 1809, two were drafted into their first battalion,
which had come out to the Peninsula;<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> one (2/87th) was
sent away for a time to Cadiz, though it returned to the field<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
army in 1812; four were cut down in 1811–12 to half
battalions.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> Only one, the 2/83rd, remained continuously
in the Peninsula as a full battalion till the end of the war.</p>

<p>The same fate attended the single-battalion regiments,
which had no sister battalion at home to draw upon, but
only a depôt. Both the 29th and the 97th went home,
reduced to skeletons, in 1811.</p>

<p>But the six first-battalions present with the field army
in May, 1809, were still at the front in fair strength at the
termination of the war in 1814, and this, though two of them
had been among the worst sufferers in the bloody field of
Albuera. Indeed, there is throughout the war, I believe,
only one case in which the first battalion of a complete
regiment went out to the front, and was sent away before
the end of the campaigning in 1814.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reinforcements from Home</div>

<p>The reinforcements which were sent out to Wellington
from 1810 to 1812 may be divided into two sections, of
which the larger was composed of the reorganized and
recruited battalions of Moore’s Corunna army. Of these,
six battalions came out in 1810, nine in 1811, eight in 1812,
and three in 1813–14. The greater number of them were
first battalions, or putting aside the Guards and German
Legion units, fifteen out of twenty-three: of these all save
one (the 1/26th) fought out the rest of the war. Of single-battalion
regiments there were four (2nd, 51st, 20th, 76th);
of junior battalions belonging to corps which already had
one battalion abroad, there were also only three (3/1st,
2/52nd, 2/59th). Of these two last classes the 2/52nd was
soon sent home, after drafting its men into the 1/52nd.
The 2nd got so depleted that it was cut down to four
companies, and put into a provisional battalion in 1812 till
the end of the war. The 76th on its return was only in the
field for a few months in 1813–14, so that it had no time
to get worked down. The 3/1st, though a junior battalion,
belonged to a large regiment of four battalions, and for that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
reason never shrank below its proper size, there being a sister
unit at home to send it drafts. We may therefore say
that, of the eight battalions which were not first battalions
of full regiments, only three saw long service, yet survived
unimpaired to the peace of 1814 (20th, 51st, 2/59th); and
of these three two only came out in 1812, and were less
than two years in the Peninsula. It is clear, then, that
the same rule prevailed in the reinforcements as in the
original 1809 army; only first battalions could be relied
upon not to melt.</p>

<p>The battalions sent out as reinforcements to Wellington
which had not formed part of Moore’s Corunna army,
were decidedly less numerous than the other class, amounting
to only nineteen. Of these six were first battalions,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>
eight second battalions,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> and five single battalion corps.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>
All of the first-named category fought out the whole war:
but several of the other two were sent home, either when
they had been depleted to reinforce their first battalions,
or for other reasons. The proportion would have been
larger but for the fact that several of them were among
the last arrivals in the Peninsula, who only joined in the
later autumn and winter campaigns of 1813–14, and had
not time to get worn down.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> One second battalion (2/58th)
was worked as a four-company unit during the last two
years of the war.</p>

<p>The net result of all the interchange of battalions, and
of the sending home of weak units, was that in 1814, when
the struggle with Napoleon had come to its end, out of
fifty-six British line battalions present at the front, only
thirteen were second battalions, and of these last five<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>
were (as has been already mentioned) so depleted in numbers
that they were being worked in pairs, being each only four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
companies strong, and not mustering more than 250 or
300 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Walcheren Regiments</div>

<p>That such weak half-units were detained in the Peninsula
was due to a resolve of Wellington’s, made after
the campaign of 1811. During the latter part of that year
the chief of his worries was that he had been sent out
among his reinforcements a number of corps which had
served in the Walcheren expedition, where almost every
man had the seeds of ague in him, from a sojourn in the
marshes of Holland. The heat of the Portuguese summer
and the torrential rains of the autumn at once brought
out the latent weakness in the constitution of men who were
little more than convalescents, and regiments which had
landed at Lisbon in July 850 strong showed only 550 in
the ranks in October.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> So appalling was the accumulation
of fever and ague cases in the hospitals<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> that Wellington
wrote home to beg that not another unit which had been
at Walcheren might be sent out to him. He now made up
his mind to keep old regiments, even when they had dwindled
rather low in numbers, rather than to send them home to
recruit, and to receive new battalions in their stead. The
reason was that it took a corps many months before it
learnt to shift for itself, and to grow acclimatized. During
their first few months in the Peninsula, newly arrived units
always showed too many sick and too many stragglers.
For men fresh from barrack life in England were at first
prostrated by the heat of the climate and the length of the
marches. They had still to pick up the old campaigner’s
tricks, and were very helpless. Veteran troops were so
superior in endurance to new regiments from England,
most of whom had been on the pestilential Walcheren
expedition, and were still full of rickety convalescents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
that Wellington determined to keep even remnants of old
corps accustomed to the air of the Peninsula, rather than
to ask for more unacclimatized battalions from home.
Hence came the institution, in the end of 1812, of two
of the “provisional battalions” already mentioned.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> At
an earlier period of the war they would undoubtedly have
been sent back to England.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> But now these fractions of
depleted veteran corps were taken, with excellent results,
all through the campaign of 1812–13–14.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fate of Second Battalions</div>

<p>It is perhaps worth while to make a note how curious
was Wellington’s attitude in face of that rather exceptional
occurrence the appearance of two strong battalions of the
same regiment in his army. If the second battalion was
weak, he soon drafted it into the first and sent it home. But
when, from some chance, both had full ranks, it did not by
any means always strike him as necessary to brigade them
together. For example, the 1/7th and 2/7th were both at
the front from October, 1810, to July, 1811; but for several
months of the time one was in the 4th Division, the other in
the 1st. A still more striking instance is that of the 48th.
Its two battalions were both from their first arrival placed
in the 2nd Division, but they served from June, 1809, to
May, 1811, in different brigades of it.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> The occasions when
the two battalions of the same regiment served for any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>time in one brigade were very rare—I only know of the
cases of the 1st and 3rd battalions of the Foot Guards in
1813–14, of the two battalions of the 52nd between March,
1811, and March, 1812, and of those of the 7th Fusiliers,
who (after some service apart) had been brigaded together
in the 4th Division six months before Albuera. In the last
two cases the first battalion presently absorbed the second,
which was sent home as a skeleton <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cadre</i> when its strength
at last began to run low. All other cases of juxtaposition
were so short that it would seem that Wellington only
brought the two battalions together for the purpose of
drafting the second into the first at the earliest convenient
moment. In this way the 2/88th (long in garrison at
Lisbon) were brought up to the front to be amalgamated
in less than four months with the 1/88th (March-July, 1811).
The 1/5th, coming out in the summer of 1812, seems to have
served along with the 2/5th for about the same number of
months, the latter being sent home in October. The 1/38th
similarly arrived at about the same time, and served from
June to November beside the 2/38th, which then departed.
These are very different cases from those of the two
battalions of the 7th, the 48th, and the 52nd, all of which
were present for a year or more together in the army.</p>

<p class="floatr"><span class="smcap">Private, Infantry of the Line.</span><br />1809.</p></div></div>

<p>The working unit of the Peninsular Army was always
the ten-company battalion, commanded by a lieutenant-colonel.
When, as in the exceptional cases just named, it
chanced that two battalions of a regiment got together, the
senior of the two commanding officers had no authority
over the other. Both were directly responsible to the
brigadier. The battalion theoretically had thirty-five officers
and 1000 rank and file, besides sergeants and drummers.
A pestilent practice prevailed in all British general returns,
of giving in statistics of the larger sort only the number
of rank and file (<i>i.e.</i> corporals and privates), officers, sergeants,
and musicians being all omitted. To bring the
figures up to the real general total in such a case, an allowance
of about one-eighth or one-ninth has to be added to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
the number given. Fortunately detailed returns of all
ranks are always available, when absolute correctness is
required, from the fortnightly general states at the Record
Office.</p>

<p>The theoretical establishment of about 1150 of all ranks
for a first battalion was, of course, hardly ever seen in the
field. Regiments which landed at Lisbon with a full
complement soon dwindled, even before they got to the
front, and nothing was rarer than a battalion in line of
battle with a total strength in the four figures.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> A good
well-managed corps which had not been in action of late,
and had not been stationed in an unhealthy cantonment,
might keep up to 700 and even 800 men throughout a
campaign. The Guards battalions, which had a decidedly
larger establishment than those of the line, were frequently
up to 900 men or more.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a battalion which had seen much
fighting, which had not received its drafts regularly, and
had long starved on the bleak mountains of Beira, or
sweltered in the pestilential valley of the Guadiana, often
worked down to 450 men or less, even if it were a first
battalion which had landed with its full 1000 rank and file.
A second battalion under similar circumstances might
shrink to 250 or 300. At the end of the very fatiguing
campaign of 1811, which had included the toilsome pursuit
of Masséna, the Fuentes de Oñoro fighting, and the long
tarrying on the Caya during the unhealthy summer heats,
of forty-six battalions present with Wellington’s main
army only nine (all save one first-battalions, and two of
them belonging to the Guards) showed more than 700 of all
ranks present. Sixteen more had between 500 and 700,
ten between 400 and 500. No less than eleven were down
to the miserable figure of under 400 men, and it is to be
noted that of these nearly all were either second battalions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
or single-battalion regiments; there were six of the former
three of the latter among them. The average of the whole,
it may be seen, was about 550 men per unit; the extreme
variation was between 1005 for the strongest battalion
and 263 for the weakest.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> At this time, it should be noted,
the army was more sickly than it had ever been before,
having over 14,000 men in hospital to 29,300 present with
the colours. Wellington was never again so encumbered
with sick, save for one period of a few weeks—that which
followed the end of the retreat from Burgos to Ciudad
Rodrigo in October-November, 1813. During the first months
of this winter the troops, tired by incessant marching in the
rain, and low feeding, sent into hospital a number of cases
not less distressing than those which had been seen in
September, 1811. But a short period of rest served to
re-establish their health, and in 1813–14 the troops were very
healthy, even during the trying weeks when many of them
were cantoned high among the snows of the Pyrenean
passes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cavalry Regiments</div>

<p>So much for the infantry regiments. A few words as
regards the cavalry must be added to this chapter on
organization. From first to last Wellington had under
him twenty-one regiments of British horse, besides four
more of the light and heavy cavalry of the King’s German
Legion. But at no time had he such a force as would
be represented by this total. He started in 1809 with
eight regiments. Before he had been many weeks in
command one of his units (a fractional one, composed of
two squadrons of the 20th Light Dragoons) was taken
from him and shipped off to Sicily. Before the end of the
year another (23rd Light Dragoons), which had been badly
cut up at Talavera, and lost half its strength there, was sent
home to recruit. Thus he had only six regiments<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
January 1, 1810, and as only one joined him that year,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a>
seven was his total force, till he at last received large
reinforcements in the late summer and autumn of 1811.
But he started the campaign of 1812 with sixteen regiments,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a>
which was almost the highest figure that he was to own.
For although during the campaign of 1813 he was sent
four new Hussar regiments, yet at the same time four
depleted corps were sent home to be recruited and reorganized.
This would have left his total at the same
figure of sixteen units as in 1812, if he had not also received
a large composite regiment (or weak brigade) composed of
two squadrons from each of the three units of the Household
Cavalry. By this addition alone did his cavalry force
in 1813–14 exceed that which he had possessed in 1812.
If we reckon the Household squadrons as roughly equivalent
to two units, the total at the end of the war was eighteen
regiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Faults of Raw Cavalry</div>

<p>Unlike the infantry, the cavalry of the British Army was
organized without exception in isolated units, as it is to-day.
A corps sent to the Peninsula left a depôt squadron behind
it, and there was no source except this depôt from which
it could draw recruits. Nothing resembling the sister-unit
on which an infantry battalion depended was in existence.
Hence if a cavalry regiment sank low in numbers, and
exhausted the drafts which the depôt squadron could send
out, it had to return to England to recruit. During the whole
war only one corps (the 23rd Light Dragoons at Talavera)
suffered a complete disaster, corresponding to that which
the 2nd Infantry Division incurred at Albuera, and this
unlucky regiment was sent home that autumn, when the
British Army had retreated to the Portuguese frontier. But
four others worked down so low in strength, and especially
in horses, during the campaign of 1812, that, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
they had none of them been thinned down in a single
action like the 23rd, they had become ineffective, and had
to quit the Peninsula. It is most noteworthy that all of
these four corps were comparatively recent arrivals; they
had come out in 1811, and in little over a single year had
fallen into a state of inefficiency far exceeding that of the
regiments whose service dated back to 1809, and who had
seen two years more of hard campaigning.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> The moral
to be drawn is the same that we have noted with the
infantry: the regiments which had served Wellington since
his first arrival had become acclimatized, and had learnt
the tricks of the old soldier. They could shift for themselves,
and (what was no less important) for their horses,
far better than any newly-arrived corps. We find bitter
complaints of the defective scouting and outpost work of
the new-comers. After a petty disaster to the outlying
pickets of two of the lately-landed regiments Wellington
wrote: “This disagreeable circumstance tends to show
the difference between old and new troops. The old regiments
of cavalry throughout all their service, with all
their losses put together, have not lost so many men as
the 2nd Hussars of the Legion and the 11th Light Dragoons
in a few days. However, we must try to make the new as
good as the old.”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> This was evidently not too easy to
accomplish; at any rate, at the end of the next year it was
four of the new corps<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> which were sent home as depleted
units, not any of the seven old ones. All these, without
exception, endured to the last campaign of 1814, though
they nearly all<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> had to be reduced from a four-squadron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
to a three-squadron establishment in the autumn of 1811,
owing to their shrunken effective. But they never fell so
low as the four corps condemned to return to England in
the next year. No more regiments went home after the
winter of 1812–13; the campaign of Vittoria and the
Pyrenees did not bear heavily on the cavalry, most of whom,
during the mountain fighting in the autumn, were comfortably
cantoned in the Ebro Valley. They only moved
forward again in the spring of 1814 for that invasion of
France which was brought to such an abrupt end by the
fall of Napoleon.</p>

<p>The theoretical establishment of the regiments of
cavalry (putting aside the Household Cavalry) was in 1809
fixed at 905 men in nearly every case. But a large depôt
was always left behind in England, and if a regiment
landed 600 sabres in Portugal, in four squadrons, it was up
to the average strength. At the front it would seldom
show more than 450, as horses began to die off or go sick
the moment that they felt the Peninsular air and diet.
A regiment which had been reduced from four squadrons
to three might show only 300 men on parade in the middle
of a campaign.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI" class="vspace">CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="subhead">INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF THE REGIMENT: THE OFFICERS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Hitherto we have been dealing with the regiment considered
as a whole, and mainly with its place in the brigade
and division to which it had been allotted. We must now
pass on to consider it not as a whole, but as an assemblage
of parts—officers, staff, sergeants, rank and file, and
musicians.</p>

<p>To understand the mechanism of a regiment it is first
necessary to say something about the establishment of
officers. Battalions and cavalry regiments were normally
commanded by a lieutenant-colonel: there were very few
full colonels with the army, and almost the only ones who
commanded a unit were those of the brigades of Guards,
where owing to the “double rank” which made all lieutenants
“captains in the army,” all captains lieutenant-colonels,
and all majors and lieutenant-colonels <em>full</em> colonels,
it resulted that the battalion commander always held a
colonelcy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Devolution of Command</div>

<p>When the lieutenant-colonel in a battalion was dead,
wounded, or sick, the unit was often commanded by the
senior major—there were normally two of them—sometimes
for many months at a time, till the absent officer returned,
or his place was filled by promotion. Cases were known
where, owing to great mortality or invaliding in the senior
ranks, a captain might be found in command of the battalion
for a certain space. I note that about the time of Bussaco
the “morning state” of the army shows two units (both of
the Guards) commanded by colonels, 30 by lieutenant-colonels,
16 by majors, one by a captain, and this, I think,
was a fairly normal proportion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
In addition to the colonel and the two majors, an
infantry battalion at full strength would possess ten
captains and twenty subalterns, or a trifle more, giving the
allowance of three officers per company, with a few over.
How many of the subalterns would be lieutenants and how
many ensigns (called 2nd lieutenants in the rifle regiments)
was a matter of mere chance, but the lieutenants were
nearly always in a majority.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> A glance down the morning
state of the Bussaco army of September, 1811, shows that
one battalion (1/45th) had no more than one ensign, another
(the 74th) as many as eleven. It was very rare for a regiment
to have its full establishment of ten captains present;
there were nearly always one or two companies commanded
by their senior lieutenants. In addition to its company
officers every battalion had its “staff,” composed of the
adjutant, paymaster, quartermaster, and the surgeon, with
his two assistant surgeons. The adjutant was usually a
lieutenant, but occasionally an ensign; in the Guards
(where most ranks counted a step higher than in the line),
he was usually a “lieutenant and captain.” In addition to
the officers regularly commissioned, a battalion had often
with it one or two “volunteers”—young men who were
practically probationers; they were allowed to come out
to an active-service battalion on the chance of being
gazetted to it without purchase, on their own responsibility.
They carried muskets and served in the ranks, but were
allowed to wear uniforms of a better cloth than that given
to the rank and file, and messed with the officers.</p>

<p>The most astonishing case of devolution of acting rank
through the death or wounding of many seniors was at the
battle of Albuera. On the morning after that action the
wrecks of the second brigade of the 2nd Division, temporarily
united into one battalion because of the dreadful losses
which had fallen on every one of the three units of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
it consisted, were commanded by the senior captain of the
1/48th regiment—and he (as it chanced) was a French
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">emigré</i>, with the somewhat lugubrious name of Cimitière.
The brigade had been reduced (it may be remarked) from a
strength of 1651 to 597 in the battle, no less than 1054
officers and men being killed, wounded, or missing, and
the brigadier, with five lieutenant-colonels and majors
senior to Cimitière having been killed or wounded.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> But
the Albuera losses were, of course, the record in the way of
heavy casualties; there is nothing that can be compared
to them in the annals of Wellington’s army for general
slaughter extending all through an army, though certain
individual regiments in particular engagements suffered
almost as heavily—<i>e.g.</i> in the storm of Badajoz and at
Waterloo.</p>

<p>The chances of temporary command were sometimes
curious. The gallant Colborne, whom I have already had
occasion to mention, though only a lieutenant-colonel, commanded
a brigade at Albuera, owing to the absence of the
brigadier—he being the senior of four battalion commanders.
He then commanded his own regiment only
during 1811–13, but succeeded as senior lieutenant-colonel
to the charge of a brigade of the Light Division for the last
six months of the war. Though he had thus twice commanded
a brigade with distinction in the Peninsula, we find
him in the Waterloo campaign once more at the head of
his own 52nd Foot, in Adam’s brigade. It is true that
with his single battalion he there did more than most of
the generals, by giving the decisive stroke which wrecked
the attack of the French Guard.</p>

<p>Not only did lieutenant-colonels practically become
brigadiers, in an interim fashion, pretty frequently, but
once at least an officer with no higher rank commanded a
whole division for some months. This was Colonel Andrew
Barnard, who after Craufurd fell at Ciudad Rodrigo, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
the only other general with the division (Vandeleur) was
wounded, had charge of the most precious unit of Wellington’s
whole army for nearly five months, and headed it at
the storm of Badajoz. There seems to have been a similar,
but a shorter phenomenon of this sort with the 3rd Division,
after the fall of Badajoz, when, Generals Picton and Kempt
being both disabled, Colonel Wallace of the Connaught
Rangers commanded the division for a week or two—till
Wellington drafted in his brother-in-law, General Pakenham,
to lead it, which he did with great distinction at
Salamanca.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Purchase System</div>

<p>Promotion in the British Army at this period was working
in the most irregular and spasmodic fashion, there
being two separate influences operating in diametrically
opposite ways. The one was the purchase system, the
other the frequent, but not by any means sufficiently
frequent, promotion for merit and good service in the field.
The practice at the Horse Guards was that casualties by
deaths in action were filled up inside the regiment, without
money passing, but that for all other vacancies the purchase
system worked. When a lieutenant-colonelcy, majority,
or captaincy was vacant, the senior in the next lower rank
had a moral right to be offered the vacancy at the regulation
price. But there were many cases in which more than the
regulation could be got. The officer retiring handed over the
affair to a “commission broker,” and bidding was invited.
A poor officer at the head of those of his own rank could
not afford to pay the often very heavy price, and might see
three or four of his juniors buy their way over his head,
while he vainly waited for a vacancy by death, by which
he would obtain his step without having to pay cash. The
system of exchanges, which prevailed on the largest scale,
also pressed very hardly on the impecunious; officers from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
other corps, where there was a block in promotion, managed
for themselves a transference into battalions where there
seemed to be a likelihood of a more rapid change of rank,
by paying large differences for an exchange to those who
stood at the head of the list. But there was also a good
deal of exchanging for other reasons—officers whose regiments
were ordered to unhealthy or unpopular stations,
such as the West Indies or New South Wales, offered considerable
sums to others who were ready to accept the
ineligible destination in return for hard cash. By careful
management of this sort, a wealthy officer could procure
himself very rapid promotion—<i>e.g.</i> a lieutenant might buy
a captaincy in a West India regiment for a comparatively
modest sum, and then, as a captain in such a corps, exchange
on a second payment with a broken or needy captain in
some other regiment on a European station, to whom
money was all-important, and so get well established in his
new rank, without ever really having quitted home, or
served in the corps into and out of which he had rapidly
come and gone—on paper only. It is said that one young
officer, who had the advantages of being wealthy, a peer,
and possessed of great family influence in Parliament, was
worked up from a lieutenancy to a lieutenant-colonelcy in
a single year. This, of course, was a very exceptional case,
and happened long ere the Peninsular War began; but it
may be remembered that Wellington himself, was, through
similar advantages on a smaller scale, enabled to move up
from ensign on March 7, 1787, to lieutenant-colonel in
September, 1793—five steps in seven years, during which he
had been moved through as many regiments—two of horse
and five of foot. He was only nineteen months a captain
and six months a major, and he had seen no war service
whatever when he sailed for Flanders in command of the
33rd at the age of twenty-three! The Duke of York later
insisted on a certain minimum service in each rank before
promotion could be obtained.</p>

<p>Contrast with such promotion that of the poor and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
friendless officer who, after twenty-five years of service,
six Peninsular campaigns, and two wounds, found himself
still a captain at the age of 43!<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> But there were plenty of
unlucky men who at the end of the war were still only
lieutenants after six campaigns, and were placed on half-pay
as such, at the great disbandment of the second battalions
which took place in 1816–17. The juxtaposition of rapid
promotion obtainable by influence and the purchase of
steps, with absolute stagnation in a low rank, which often
fell on the impecunious officer, whose regiment did not
chance to have many casualties in action, was appalling and
monstrous.</p>

<p>I take it that the most pernicious of all the disturbing
causes which told against the right distribution of promotion
was political influence. As a contemporary pamphleteer
wrote: “Instances are very few indeed of preferment
being obtained by other corrupt means<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> compared to the
omnipotence of Parliamentary interest. Thence originates
the shameful practice of thrusting boys into a company
over the heads of all the lieutenants and ensigns of the
regiment. The Duke of York has done something to check
it, but he can never remove the Colossus of Parliamentary
interest, an interest that disdains solicitation, and imperiously
<em>demands</em> from the minister of the day that which no
minister ever found it convenient to deny. To this species
of influence the commander-in-chief must give way—for
it is capable, when slighted, of removing both commander-in-chief
and minister.”<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The King’s Hard Bargains</div>

<p>It was to the unscrupulous use by great men of their
parliamentary influence upon the ministry of the day that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
army owed a great proportion of its “King’s hard bargains”
in the commissioned ranks. The obscure but necessary
instruments of one of the great borough-mongers—Whig no
less than Tory—were often paid by the nomination of their
sons or other young relatives to a commission, by the influence
of their patron: and the families that did the dirty work of
a great politician were not likely to be distinguished for
high morals or uprightness. Sometimes the nominations
were absolutely shameful—it is said that the son of the
keeper of a fashionable gaming-house in St. James’ was
slid into the list of ensigns on one occasion, by a politician
whom his father had obliged. Whether this be true or not,
it is certain that there was a sprinkling of officers who were
not gentlemen in any sense of the term serving throughout
the war.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> Others about whose gentle blood there was no
doubt, were undesirable in other ways—prominent among
them a section of young Irish squireens with the bullying
and duelling habits, as well as the hard-drinking, which
were notoriously prevalent among the less civilized strata of
society beyond St. George’s Channel. I find in one memoir
a note of a newly-joined ensign after mess addressing the
assembled officers as follows: “By Jasus, gentlemen, I
am conscious you must have the meanest opinion of my
courage. Here have I been no less than six weeks with
the regiment, and the divil of a duel have I fought yet.
Now, Captain C., you are the senior captain, and if you
please I will begin with you first: so name your time and
place.” As the diarist very wisely writes, “one could not
be too guarded in one’s conduct with such heroes.”<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<p>Duels, I may remark in passing, were much less frequent
in the Peninsular Army than might have been expected.
Wellington (though long after he most foolishly “went
out” with Lord Winchelsea in 1829) set his face against
them on active service, because he could not afford to lose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
good officers on account of personal quarrels. There
certainly were much fewer duels proportionately in the
Peninsula than in England at the time—not to speak of
Ireland and India, where they were beyond all reason
common. I have only found records of four fatal duels in
the records of court-martials, and though non-fatal ones
could have been (and were) hushed up, they cannot have
been very numerous, for one may read through scores of
memoirs and diaries without running upon the mention of
one. It is curious to note that when they did occur, and a
court-martial followed, that body invariably found that
though there was no doubt that Captain A. or Lieutenant
B. was dead, yet there was no conclusive proof that he had
been killed by C. or D.—the mouths of the seconds being
sealed by the fact that they were also on their trial for
having acted in such a capacity.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> The whole matter was
clearly a solemn farce. But the fact remains that duels
were not frequent, and that duellists had a bad mark
against them. Good commanding officers took immense
trouble to prevent a duel from arising over silly mess-table
quarrels, exerting every influence to make one party, or
both, apologize for words spoken in anger, or in liquor.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<p>The body of officers of a Peninsular regiment was often
a very odd party—there might be a lieutenant-colonel of
twenty-six, who had risen rapidly by purchase or interest,
and captains of fifty or even sixty; I found a note of one
who had attained that age in the 73rd. At the head of
each rank there might be several impecunious and disappointed
men, waiting for the promotion that could only
come by casualties in action, since they could never hope to
purchase their step. Nevertheless, the feuds that might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
have been expected to follow such a situation do not seem
to have been so many, or so bitter, as might have been
expected. The grudge was set against the system rather
than the individual, in most cases, and the sight of a mess
cut up into cliques and coteries of enemies, though it can
be found recorded occasionally, was quite exceptional.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>
The saving fact was that there was always the chance of
promotion for merit, in reward of some specially gallant deed,
and it often came—though the Duke was occasionally
incomprehensible in the way in which he mentioned or did
not mention officers in dispatches. The lieutenant who
brought down the French flag from the castle of Badajoz,
and who was sent with it by Picton to the commander-in-chief,
was thanked and asked to dinner, but was still a
lieutenant years after, in spite of his general’s vehement
remonstrances.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> Dozens of such instances could be
quoted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Professional Training</div>

<p>Professional training for officers had perforce been non-existent
in the early years of the French war. There was no
institution which supplied it, and all military knowledge
had to be acquired by rule of thumb at regimental headquarters.
An improvement of the greatest importance was
made by the establishment in December, 1801, of the
“Royal Military College” at High Wycombe for the use of
young officers, followed by the creation of its “Junior
Department” in May, 1802, “for the instruction of those
who from early life are intended for the military profession.”
The latter, the origin of the college at Sandhurst,
to which the department was removed in 1811, accepted
boys as early as thirteen. Its first inspector-general was the
French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">emigré</i> Jarry, to whom we owe the “Instructions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
for Light Infantry in the Field” of 1804, while Colonel
John Gaspard Le Marchant was “Lieutenant-governor and
Superintendant General.” This was the accomplished
cavalry officer who fell in 1812, at the head of his
brigade, in the crisis of the battle of Salamanca, when
he had just delivered a decisive charge. The military
college men were already numerous when the Peninsular
War began.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The “Belemites”</div>

<p>The French General, Foy, a witness whose authority
can hardly be called in question, for he is making grudging
admissions, says that he considered the general mass of
the British officers excellent.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> The more we study detailed
records, the more willingly do we acknowledge that his
praise is well deserved. The weaker brethren were very
few—so few that an enemy did not even notice them.
Misconduct on the field was the rarest of offences; there
are hardly half a dozen court-martials for suspected slackness,
among the hundreds that were held for other offences.
There were an appreciable number of officers “broke”
for faults that came from hard drinking, “incapable when on
duty,” and so forth, or brawling, and a very few for financial
irregularities; but considering the unpromising material
that was sometimes pitchforked into a regiment by the
unscrupulous exercise of patronage at home, they were
exceedingly few. The only class of failures who had any
appreciable numbers, and earned a special name, were
the “Belemites,” so called from the general depôt at the
convent of Belem in the suburbs of Lisbon. This was the
headquarters of all officers absent from the front as convalescents
or on leave, and the limited proportion who
stayed there over-long, and showed an insufficient eagerness
to return to their regiments, were nicknamed from the spot
where they lingered beyond the bounds of discretion. Wellington
occasionally gave an order to Colonel Peacocke, the
military governor of Lisbon, to rout up this coterie—there
were always a sprinkling there who were not over-anxious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
to resume the hard life of campaigning, and loved too much
the gambling-hells and other sordid delights of Lisbon.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>
Occasionally the notices which appear in General Orders
about these gentry are rather surprising—one would not
have thought that such men could even have obtained a
commission. Take, for example, “The commanding officer
at Lisbon (or the commanding officer of any station at
which Captain —— of the 88th may happen to be found),
will be pleased to place that officer under arrest, and send
him to join his regiment, he having been absent for several
months without leave, and having been in Portugal since
October 20th last, without reporting himself to or communicating
with his commanding officer.”<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<p>Wellington in his moments of irritation sometimes
wrote as if the majority of his officers were slack and disobedient.
Such men existed; but, as one who knew the
Duke well observed, “by long exercise of absolute power
he had become intolerant of the slightest provocation, and
every breach of discipline, no matter how limited its range,
made him furious with the whole army. Hence frequent
General Orders, as violent as they were essentially unjust,
wherein, because of the misdeeds of a few, all who served
under him were denounced—the officers as ignorant of their
duty, the rank and file as little better than a rabble.”<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<p>But the duty-shirking officer, and still more the disreputable
officer was, after all, a very rare exception. The
atmosphere of contempt which surrounded him in his
regiment as a rule sufficed to make him send in his papers,
after a longer or a shorter period of endurance, in proportion
as his skin was tough or thin. Opinion was not
so hard upon the man who was merely quarrelsome and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
ungentlemanly in his cups. But there were limits even
to the boisterousness permitted to the tippler, and drunkenness
when in face of the enemy, or in a position of
military responsibility, was always fatal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Officers from the Ranks</div>

<p>There was, throughout the war, a perceptible proportion
of officers who had risen from the ranks. Meritorious
service, showing good capacity as well as courage, not
unfrequently led to the promotion of a sergeant to an
ensigncy. A well-remembered case is that of the Sergeant
Newman of the 43rd who rallied the stragglers during the
march from Lugo to Betanzos, in the Corunna retreat, and
beat off the pursuing French dragoons. Another is that of
Sergeant Masterson of the 2/87th, who captured the eagle
of the <em>8th Ligne</em> at Barrosa. Many more might be quoted,
though none of them is so striking as that of a man who
did not serve in the Peninsula, but in contemporary campaigns
in India, the celebrated John Shipp. He was <em>twice</em>
given a commission for deeds of exceptional daring. After
winning his first ensigncy in the storming party at the
Siege of Bhurtpoor in 1805, he was forced to “sell out”
a little later by improvident living. He enlisted as a private
in another regiment, and was again promoted from the
ranks for a single combat with a Nepaulese chief during
the first Goorkha War of 1815. Conducting himself with
more wisdom on his second chance, he served long as an
officer, and when he went on half-pay became chief-constable
of Liverpool. His autobiography is an artless and
interesting piece of work well worth perusal.</p>

<p>When a regiment had greatly distinguished itself in
the field, Wellington not unfrequently directed its colonel
to recommend a sergeant for a commission. This, for
example, was done for all three battalions of the Light
Division after their splendid exploit at Bussaco. Yet he
did not approve of this system of promotion as anything
but a very exceptional measure, and in his table-talk with
Lord Stanhope we find some very harshly worded verdicts
on old rankers, “their origin would come out, and you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
could never perfectly trust them,”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> especially in the
matter of drink. This seems to be a typical instance of
the Duke’s aristocratic prejudices—but there was something
in what he said. The position of the promoted
sergeants was certainly difficult, and it required a man of
exceptional character to make it good. As a rule, they
drifted into the position of paymasters, recruiting officers,
barrack masters, and such-like posts. But many of them
made useful and efficient adjutants. In command they
were not as a rule successful,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> and I have only come on a
single case of one who reached the rank of full colonel, and
of two who were fortunate enough to obtain a majority.
It is clear that the purchase system pressed very hardly
upon them: with no private resources it was impossible
for them ever to buy a step, and, after reaching the rank
of captain, they almost invariably went upon half-pay or
looked for employment in some civil or semi-civil capacity.</p>

<p>Concerning the equipment of the officer, his baggage,
his horses and mules, and his servants, information will
be found in another chapter. Here we are dealing with
him as an item in the machinery of the regiment.</p>

</div>

<p>He who would make himself acquainted in detail with the
many experiments by which British Governments, from the
rupture of the Peace of Amiens onward, strove to keep on
foot in full numbers the very large army that it had raised,
must satisfy his curiosity by studying the admirable volumes
of Mr. Fortescue. Here we are concerned only with the
methods which prevailed from 1809 till 1814, and gave
Wellington the invincible, though often attenuated, battalions
which conquered at Talavera and Bussaco, at
Salamanca and Toulouse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Volunteers from the Militia</div>

<p>In the Peninsular Army the system of territorial names
prevailed for nearly all the regiments of the line, but in
most cases the local designation had no very close relation
with the actual <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">provenance</i> of the men. There were a
certain number of regiments that were practically national,
<i>e.g.</i> most of the Highland battalions, and nearly all of the
Irish ones, were very predominantly Highland and Irish
as to their rank and file: but even in the 79th or the 88th
there was a certain sprinkling of English recruits. And
in some nominally Scottish regiments like the 71st Highland
Light Infantry, or the 90th Perthshire Volunteers,<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> the
proportion of English and Irish was very large. Similarly
in almost all the nominally English regiments there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
large sprinkling of Irish, and a few Scots. This came partly
from the fact that, though the corps recruited in their own
districts, yet they were often allowed to send recruiting
parties to great centres like London, Bristol, Liverpool,
Glasgow, or Dublin. But still more was it due to the fact
that the larger half of the recruits were raised not in the
old normal fashion, but by volunteering from the embodied
militia, and that in this system practically no attempt was
made to confine the choice of militiamen wishing to join
the regular army to their territorial regiment. Nothing,
for example, was more usual than to find such things as
100 of the King’s County Militia joining the 31st or Huntingdonshire
Regiment. When the 77th or East Middlesex
Regiment returned from India in 1808, it was completed,
before going out to the Peninsula, from the 1st West York,
North and South Mayo, Northampton, and South Lincoln
Militia, but did not get a single man from the Middlesex
Militia.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> The Shropshire Regiment (53rd) when allowed
in a similar case to call for volunteers, did get 99 from
its own county militia, but 144 more from the Dorset,
East York, and Montgomery local corps.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> The 81st or
Loyal Lincoln was filled up in 1808, before sailing for
Portugal, from the Dublin, King’s County, South Devon,
and Montgomery Militia. Instances might be multiplied
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad nauseam</i>. It was quite exceptional for any English
corps to contain a preponderance of men from its own
nominal district, and nearly all of them had from a fifth
to a fourth of Irish.</p>

<p>It is impossible to exaggerate the advantage to the
Peninsular Army of the system, the invention of Castlereagh
when War Minister, which enabled it to draw in such a
heavy proportion on the militia for recruits.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> The men
thus obtained had all had at least twelve months’ drill and
discipline, in a corps which had been under arms for many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
years: they were trained soldiers of some little experience,
much superior in fact to the recruits who had been procured
in other ways. The permanent militia represented
the force raised by the counties by ballot, though substitutes
rather than principals were procured by that device.
Being forced to serve at home for a period of years, the
militiamen freely volunteered into the line, from love of
adventure, dislike of dull country quarters in England or
Ireland,<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> and, it must be added, the temptation of the
enormous bounty, running at various times from £16 up
to £40, which was given to those changing their service.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>It is a mistake to make a point, as some writers have
done, of the fact that many regiments appeared in Spain
with their ranks “full of raw militiamen, who sometimes
still bore their old militia badges on their knapsacks.” So
far from their being ineligible recruits, they were the very
best, for the militia of 1808–14 was not a body called out
for short service during one month of the year, but a permanent
institution which practically formed a second line
to the field army. And no man was allowed to volunteer
into the regulars till he had served a full year in the local
corps in which he had enlisted. A regiment must get drafts
on active service, and these were the very best sort that
could be obtained. Of course a corps filled up hastily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
with a great number of them, would want a little time to
shake down, but it would take far longer to assimilate a
corresponding number of ordinary recruits, hurried out
from its regimental depôt—for these men would neither
have had a whole year’s drill, nor would they have been
accustomed to the daily economy of a full regiment—depôts
seem to have been slackly administered, in many cases by
officers and sergeants invalided and past service, or who
had of their own desire shirked the service at the front.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Normal Recruit</div>

<p>The other moiety of the recruits who came out to the
Peninsula, to fill up the never-ending gaps in the ranks of
a battalion at the front, were on the whole worse material
than the militiamen. They were the usual raw stuff swept
in by the recruiting sergeant—all those restless spirits
who were caught by the attraction of the red coat, country
lads tired of the plough, or town lads who lived on the edge
of unemployment, and to whom a full stomach had been
for some time a rarity. We have autobiographies of
runaway apprentices who had bolted from a hard master,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>
and of village Lotharios who had evaded an entanglement
by a timely evasion.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> Sons of hard fathers, and stepsons
of intolerable stepmothers drifted in, and still more frequently
the rowdy spirits who were “wanted” by the
constable for assault and battery, or for some rural practical
joke which had set the parish in an uproar. The oddest
cause of enlisting that I have come upon is that of a son
of a respectable Edinburgh tradesman’s family, whose
account of the fortunes of the 71st in 1808–15 is one of the
best written of all the soldier-biographies. A stage-struck
youth with a little money in his pocket, he had often gone
on (no doubt as a super) at the Theatre Royal, carrying a
banner or a five-word message. At last the summit of his
ambition came—a friendly manager gave him a short
part, where he had actually some share in the action. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
invited all his friends to the performance to see his glory,
came on the boards, and was suddenly struck with stage
fright, so that he stood gaping and silent before the audience,
and heard the laughter and hooting begin. The poor
wretch bolted straight away from the stage in his costume
and paint, ran down to Leith, and enlisted with a sergeant
of the 71st, whose party was sailing that night for the
South. Anything was preferable to him rather than to
face next morning the jeers of the friends to whom he
had boasted of his histrionic powers, and who had come
to see his début.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Undesirable Recruits</div>

<p>But these were the better spirits. There was a much
lower stratum among the recruits, drawn from the criminal
or semi-criminal classes, whom the enormous bounty offered
for volunteers had tempted into the service—generally with
the purpose of getting out of it again as soon as possible.
Not only were there poachers, smugglers, and street-corner
roughs, who had been offered by the local authorities the
choice between enlistment and the jail, but pickpockets,
coiners, and footpads, who had made London or some
other great town too hot for them, often enlisted as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pis
aller</i>, intending to desert and “jump another bounty”
when they could. But sergeants were lynx-eyed when
they found that they had enlisted a slippery customer, and
the evasive recruit often found himself kept under lock
and key in a fort, and shipped off to Spain before he got
his opportunity to abscond. The number of these “King’s
hard bargains” varied much between different regiments,
but Colborne, a good authority, says that the battalion
was lucky which had not its fifty irreclaimable bad characters,
drunkards, plunderers, stragglers, would-be deserters,
actual criminals “whom neither punishment nor any
kind of discipline could restrain; for the system of recruiting
was defective and radically bad.”<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> It was this scum,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
a small proportion of the whole, but always swimming to
the top when there was mischief to be done—peasants to
be plundered or churches to be pillaged—that provided the
subject-matter for court-martials, and engrossed the majority
of the attention of the Provost Marshal. Officers of undoubted
humanity, and men in the ranks who knew what
they were talking about, unite in stating that there was a
residuum in the Peninsular Army which could only be
governed by the lash.</p>

<p>This small percentage of irreclaimables provided the
nucleus around which misconduct sometimes grew to a
great scale, in moments of special privation or temptation.
In abominable orgies like the sack of Badajoz, or the lesser
but still disgraceful riots at Ciudad Rodrigo and San
Sebastian, it was the criminals who started the game, but
the drunkards—a far more numerous class—who took it
up. When the drink was in them, the mob was capable of
any freak of wanton mischief or cruelty. Wellington more
than once complained that the most reckless and ungovernable
of his rowdies were the newly-joined Irish recruits. It
seems that when in liquor they became irresponsible madmen,
and had not undergone enough of discipline to get them
into a habit of obedience, which might serve as a substitute
for moral sense. And I can well believe this from casual
evidence picked up in the diaries of his obscure subordinates.
The account of the difficulties of officers and sergeants in
getting a large draft of Irish recruits from Cashel to Deal,
which I met in one soldier-diary reads like a nightmare<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>—or
a glimpse of some primitive pagan heaven, in which all
was objectless fighting in the intervals between frequent
and limitless potations. As a side-light on the national
failing, I may quote the fact that going through the complete
record of general court-martials for the whole period 1809–14,
I found that after putting aside all trials of officers, non-combatants,
and foreign auxiliaries (the last almost always
for desertion) there was an unmistakable over-percentage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
of men with Irish names, just as there was an under-percentage
of Scots. The offences for which the former
were tried were generally desertion and crimes of violence,
plundering or maltreating the peasantry.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></p>

<p>The way in which the habitually criminal element
makes itself visible in this list of court-martials is in the
not infrequent cases of scientific and habitual burglary,
robbery of the convoys going to the military chest, or of
the private property of officers, and the stealing of church
plate—all offences often punished with death, for Wellington
rarely pardoned the professional thief, though he sometimes
let off a deserter with a sound flogging. But the queerest
glimpse into the lowest stratum of the army is the curious
anecdote recorded in Napier’s fifth volume. Nonplussed in
the winter of 1813–14 by the refusal of the French peasantry
to accept the dollars or the guineas which were all that he
could offer, Wellington determined to set up a mint of his
own, which should melt down Spanish and Portuguese
silver and recoin it in the form of five franc pieces. He
sent private appeals to the colonels to find him all the
professional coiners that they could discover in the ranks,
collected as many as forty at St. Jean de Luz, and with
their aid struck a large quantity of money, of which he was
careful to see that the weight and the purity were both
correct.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Gentleman-Ranker</div>

<p>Occasionally the gentleman-ranker was to be found in
a Peninsular regiment. He was generally an “undesirable,”
who had enlisted in consequence of some disgraceful
quarrel with a family who had refused to do anything more
for him. Persistent drink, gambling, or dishonesty were
the usual causes that had broken him—not undeserved
misfortune or dire poverty. Occasionally he pulled himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
together, became a good soldier, and was ultimately
promoted to a commission. More often he sank into a
persistent drunkard or a criminal. Surtees of the 95th,
in an interesting chapter, gives the biographies of the four
privates of this class that he had known.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> One conducted
himself well for some years, became a paymaster-sergeant,
and then broke out into a wild fit of dissipation, embezzled
the company’s money, and committed suicide on detection.
The second was always in scrapes: finally he was caught
deserting to the French, and was lucky to get off with penal
servitude for life instead of death. The third, “always
excessively wild,” was once made a corporal, but was not
fit for that or any other rank. The fourth was one of the
exceptional cases—being a retired lieutenant without
friends or means, who had enlisted as a private in sheer
poverty. He was an exemplary and deserving man, who
was soon made secretary, or private clerk, to his colonel,
behaved excellently, and was in the end restored to his
former rank in the army by interest made in his behalf.</p>

<p>A regiment on Peninsular service depended for its
strength on the regularity with which it was fed from its
home-battalion or its depôt. Whenever a convoy sailed
from Spithead, it contained an immense number of small
detachments, varying from a few scores to over a hundred
men, under charge of officers newly gazetted to the service
battalion, or returning from sick leave. There was often
much wrangling on shipboard (unless the weather reduced
every one to the same level of nausea and helplessness),
not only between the men but between the young officers
in charge of them. After an angry comparison of the exact
date of commissions, which settled seniority in the choice
of berths, and in dealing with the transport-captain, two
ensigns in charge of detachments would often settle down
to a feud destined to last for the whole voyage to Lisbon.
Their men gleefully joined in the wrangle. There are
some absurd sidelights, in court-martials, on these frequent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
shipboard quarrels, which sometimes ended in affrays and
“conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.”</p>

<p>When a detachment landed at Lisbon, the officer in
charge, often a lad of sixteen, had to shepherd his flock to
the front, perhaps over 200 miles of mountain roads.
Neither officers nor men knew a word of Portuguese, or
had the slightest notion of the manners, government,
prejudices, or food of the peasantry. They went forward
in a perpetual haze of mistakes and misunderstandings.
Every draft had its percentage of undesirables, or even of
criminals. Hence the young officer, responsible for their
safe delivery at the front, found himself embroiled in
constant disputes with the natives, often ending in his
arrest on his final arrival at headquarters. We must feel
nothing but sympathy for the unfortunate young man who
delivered only twenty-nine out of a detachment of forty-one
entrusted to him; or the other who found that fourteen men
out of twenty had privately disposed of their new blankets.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a>
The only way of managing the draft was by reliance on the
sergeant or two who formed a part of it: and if the sergeant
was himself a sluggard or a tippler, ill fared his superior.
Imagine the feelings of the second-lieutenant who having
left his one non-commissioned officer behind, to hunt up
footsore stragglers, found no one arrive at the nightly
billet, and returning for miles to seek the lost ones, discovered
his sergeant dead drunk and snoring in the middle
of the high-road.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> Ability to conduct a draft to the battalion
was one of the greatest tests of the character and capacity
of a junior officer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Concerning Sergeants</div>

<p>The responsibility of the non-commissioned officer
cannot be exaggerated. It was easy to make sergeants,
but not easy to secure them of the proper quality. Too
often the man promoted for an act of courage or of quick
cleverness had to be reduced to the ranks again, for some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
hopeless failing—he was prone to drink,<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> or he was an
over-harsh or an over-slack administrator of discipline.
One of the commoner types of court-martial was that of
the non-commissioned officer who connived at and profited
by the misdeeds of the men under his charge—whose
silence was bought by a percentage, when peasants were
plundered, or convoys lightened of food, shoes, or clothing.
It was often difficult to get at him—to prove that he had
known of what was going on, and had contrived to see
nothing. But the numbers of reductions to the ranks
were notable, and lashes were often added when part of
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">corpus delicti</i> was found in the sergeant’s pack.</p>

<p>However, the ideal sergeant was not unfrequently found,
and when found he was invaluable; he had to be a steady
man with a modicum of education and a sense of duty,
who could be relied upon neither to connive at his men’s
graver faults, nor, on the other hand, to be perpetually
spying on them and reporting them to their captains for
every minute breach of discipline. Tact was as necessary as
the power to get orders carried out. The bullying sergeant
would, in the end, get left in some quandary or dilemma by
the men that he was always harrying, while the considerate
sergeant would get the benefit of his popularity by receiving
loyal and intelligent service instead of mere obedience.</p>

<p>Most important of all non-commissioned officers was
the sergeant-major, concerning whose position I cannot
do better than quote the homily of a Highland soldier
more given to philosophical disquisitions than most of the
diarists from the ranks.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<p>“The sergeant-major has an arduous duty to perform;
in all the arrangements of regimental duty he takes, or ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
to take, the most active concern. He has, of course, been
considered by his colonel a meritorious man, before he appoints
him to this highest step to which a non-commissioned
officer can attain: and, as it is frequently found necessary
to consult him on the interior economy of the regiment, if
he is possessed of any talents they are sure to be seen and
called forth. Fortunate is the regiment which possess a
good sergeant-major. His rank is not such as to make him
above associating with and advising the other non-commissioned
officers: his own personal example is the means
of swaying their actions: he cautions them against unjust
oppression, yet shrinks not from pointing out the cases
which require coercive measures. He recommends for
promotion those who meritoriously aspire to rise from the
ranks. His commanding officer is seldom troubled with
complaints, for he settles them to the satisfaction of the
accuser and accused. No mercenary motive actuates his
conduct in reconciling differences, and his hands are never
soiled with the gift of an inferior. To those who are unacquainted
with the influence which sergeant-majors
generally possess this may seem a hyperbole; but to me
it appears a fact; I speak not of one regiment but of many.
A sergeant-major, on the other hand, can be a little tyrant
in the corps, without the knowledge of his colonel: his
unnecessary acts of oppression may be made to appear to
his superiors as laudable zeal, and his severity as merit
deserving reward.... If the commanding officer be of
an easy, complying turn, or again of a repulsive, haughty,
<em>don’t-trouble-me</em> disposition, and the adjutant (which is
often the case) not over well informed, the sergeant-major
is consulted on all occasions. His opinion is asked as to
character, he can establish or injure at pleasure, for who
will be called in to contradict him? In short he has much
more to say between the non-commissioned officers and
the colonel, concerning the poor soldiers’ conduct, than all
the captains and subalterns of the regiment.”<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sergeant’s Self-Respect</div>

<p>The gap between the sergeant and the men in the
ranks was necessarily a well-marked one. The non-commissioned
officers kept together and formed messes of their
own. “Pride and propriety” kept them from joining in
the carouses of the rank and file. “He who has once joined
the company of sergeants is disincluded for any other,”<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a>
writes one veteran proud of well-deserved promotions. The
non-commissioned officer who was too familiar with his
inferiors was generally one of those who profited by their
misdeeds, and would some day be convicted of sharing
their plunder, or conniving at their excesses.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE AUXILIARIES: THE GERMANS AND THE PORTUGUESE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Of the two classes of foreign troops which assisted to
make up the invincible divisions of the Peninsular Army,
the one formed at the time an integral part of the British
military establishment; the other was the contingent of
an allied Power, placed at the disposition of Wellington,
and incorporated with the units of his host, but preserving
its own national individuality.</p>

<p>We must deal with the first class before we proceed to
explain the position of the second. Copying old British
precedent, the governments of George III. had taken into
pay a number of foreign corps from the very commencement
of the Revolutionary War. They were the successors
of the Hanoverians against whom the elder Pitt had railed
so fiercely in his hot youth, and of the Hessians who had
taken such a prominent part in the War of American
Independence.</p>

<p>The regiments raised in the early years of the great
struggle with France had mainly been composed of Swiss,
or of French royalist <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">emigrés</i>. Most of these corps had
disappeared by 1809, and of those of them which survived
the majority were doing garrison duty in the Mediterranean
and elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> Wellington never had them under his
hand. The foreign troops which came under his command
were nearly all German, and consisted of regiments raised
after the rupture of the Peace of Amiens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The King’s German Legion</div>

<p>By far the largest number of them belonged to that
admirable corps the King’s German Legion, whose history
was written with great care and enthusiasm by Ludlow
Beamish, while the generation which fought in the Peninsula
was still alive. They were the legitimate representatives
of the old Electoral army of Hanover, the comrades of the
British troops in many a fight of the War of the Austrian
Succession and of the Seven Years’ War. When in June,
1803, Napoleon invaded Hanover, and overran it with the
troops of Mortier, the 15,000 men who formed the standing
army of the electorate could make no effective resistance.
They laid down their arms in accordance with the Convention
of Lauenburg (July 5, 1803), which disbanded them,
and permitted officers and men to go where they pleased,
with the proviso that none of them would bear arms
against France till they should have been exchanged
for French officers or men in the hands of the English
Government.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></p>

<p>The best and most loyal of the Hanoverian officers
began at once to betake themselves to England, and by
the end of the year were streaming thither by dozens and
scores. Men soon began to follow in considerable numbers,
and after two provisional infantry regiments had been
formed in August, a larger organization, to be called the
King’s German Legion, was authorized in December. It
included light and line infantry, heavy and light cavalry,
artillery and engineers. All through 1804 new units were
being rapidly created, mainly from Hanoverians, but not
entirely, for other recruits of German nationality were
accepted. But all the officers, nearly all the sergeants,
and the large majority of the rank and file came from the
old Electoral army. By January, 1805, there were in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
existence a dragoon and a hussar regiment, four Line and
two Light battalions, and five batteries of artillery.</p>

<p>In November, 1805, when Lord Cathcart’s expedition
sailed for the Weser, to make a diversion in favour of
Austria, the whole German Legion went with him. For
a few short weeks the invaders were in possession of Bremen
and Verden, Stade, and Hanover city, before the news of
the disastrous peace that followed Austerlitz came to hand.
During this space immense numbers of Hanoverians flocked
to the colours, some old soldiers, others volunteers who
had not served before. When the army evacuated Hanover
in February, 1806, it brought back so many recruits that
the Legion was raised to ten battalions of infantry and
five regiments of horse.</p>

<p>These were almost the last genuine Hanoverians that
were raised for service in the corps, for when the electorate
was annexed to Jerome Bonaparte’s “Kingdom of Westphalia,”
it became part of the French Imperial system,
and was subjected to the conscription for Jerome’s service.
Only a few individuals henceforth succeeded in getting to
England and joining the Legion by circuitous ways. But
there were some good recruits obtained at Stralsund and
in Denmark during the Copenhagen Expedition at the
end of 1807, when the Legion was for some weeks in the
Baltic.</p>

<p>The battalions and squadrons were still mainly Hanoverian,
when, in 1808, the larger half of them was sent to
the Peninsula. In that year one Hussar regiment (the 3rd),
two Light and four Line battalions (Nos. 1, 2, 5, 7), landed
in Portugal. Of these only the two Light battalions and the
Hussars marched with Moore, and re-embarked for England
after his disastrous retreat. The four Line battalions
remained in Portugal, as did two German batteries, and
made part of Wellesley’s original army of 1809. They
were joined in the spring of that year by the 1st Hussars,
who (as has been already mentioned) were considered the
most efficient light cavalry regiment in Portugal, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
were long the chosen comrades of Craufurd’s Light
Division.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recruiting the K.G.L.</div>

<p>In the spring of 1811 the K.G.L. contingent in Portugal
was increased by the 2nd Hussars and the two Light Battalions,
who returned about two years after their departure
in the company of Moore. In the winter of 1811–12 the
two heavy dragoon regiments joined Wellington’s army.
Thus in the beginning of 1812 four of the five cavalry
regiments, and five (the 7th Line battalion had gone home)
of the ten infantry battalions were serving in Spain. But
at the end of the year the 2nd Hussars were drafted back
to England, owing to depleted numbers.</p>

<p>It had now become impossible to keep the ranks of the
Legion filled with the genuine Hanoverians who had been
its original nucleus. Communication with the electorate
was completely cut off, and German recruits of any kind
had to be accepted. Many of them were volunteers from
the English prison camps, where thousands of Napoleon’s
German troops were lying. Of these only a fraction were
Hanoverians born. The large majority could not, of
course, share in the loyalty and enthusiasm of the original
legionaries, being subjects of all manner of sovereigns in
the Rheinbund, who had marched at Napoleon’s orders.
The quality of men was much worse, and many enlisted only
to escape from prison life, and readily deserted when they
reached the front, having no interest in the cause for which
they were fighting. From 1811 onward desertion, not at
all usual in the early years of the Legion, became very
common, and plunder and misconduct (previously very
rare) were also rife. Matters became still worse when,
later in the war, German recruits of any sort became so
hard to obtain that Poles, Illyrians, and miscellaneous
foreigners of any sort<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> were drafted out to fill the shrinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
ranks. But the splendid Hanoverian officers still continued
to get good service out of a rank and file that was
no longer so homogeneous or loyal as it had been when the
war began, and the regiments of the German Legion, the
cavalry in especial, continued to be among Wellington’s
most trusted troops. The charge of Bock’s Heavy Dragoons
at Garcia Hernandez, on the day after Salamanca, was, as
has been already stated, considered by Foy to have been
the most brilliant and successful cavalry attack made in
the whole Peninsular War. After the peace of 1814 all
the “mongrels” were discharged, and the officers and
native-born Hanoverian rank and file became the nucleus
on which the new Royal Army of Hanover was built up.
The fact that the aliens had been discharged in 1814 was
the cause of all the K.G.L. battalions appearing at
Waterloo in the following year with very small effectives,
in no case reaching 500 of all ranks.</p>

<p>Another foreign corps which served under Wellington
from the end of 1810 till 1814 had an origin and a history
much resembling that of the German Legion. This was
the Brunswick Oels Jägers, whose history starts from
1809. The hard-fighting Frederick William, Duke of
Brunswick, the nephew of George III., had made a gallant
diversion in Northern Germany during the Wagram Campaign.
At the head of a small body of adventurers, he had
thrown himself into the middle of Jerome Bonaparte’s
Kingdom of Westphalia, and had stirred up an insurrection
there, particularly in his own old hereditary states. He
was joined by several thousands of patriotic volunteers,
and inflicted a series of small defeats on the Westphalians.
But surrounded in the end by overwhelming numbers of
enemies, he cut his way to the sea, and embarked the
remnants of his followers aboard English ships at Brake
on the Frisian coast. The British Government at once
offered to take the refugees into its service, and from them
organized the Brunswick Oels Jäger and Hussar regiments,
whose black uniform reproduced that of the duke’s old troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Brunswick Oels Jägers</div>

<p>The kernel of this corps was originally excellent—the
officers were North-Germans, largely Prussians, who had
risked their lives by joining an insurrection contrary to
the orders of their sovereign, and could never return to
their homes: while the rank and file had been patriotic
volunteers. But, like the German Legion, the Brunswick
regiment could find no more recruits of this sort when it
had left Germany, and soon had to depend for the continuance
of its existence on the men in the English prison
camps, who could be induced to buy a release from confinement
by enlisting in the British service. It is clear that
the German Legion got the best of these turncoats, and
that the worst fell to the lot of the Brunswick corps. Not
only Germans but Poles, Swiss, Danes, Dutch, and Croats
were drafted into it. They were a motley crew, much
given to desertion—on several occasions large parties went
off together. One great court-martial in 1811 sat on ten
Brunswick Oels deserters in a body, and ordered four to be
shot and the rest to be flogged. Such men had all the
vices of the mercenary, though in time of battle they
displayed many of the virtues. Their officers had a hard
task to keep them together, and they could never be trusted
at the outposts. But the regiment was full of good shots
and bold adventurers, and furnished several of the detached
rifle companies with which Wellington strengthened the
light infantry of his brigades.</p>

<p>There was, however, one foreign regiment which was
even more tiresome to manage than the Black Brunswickers.
This was the <em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Chasseurs Britanniques</em>, a corps formed early
in the Revolutionary War from French royalists, and taken
into the British Service in 1801. It was recruited entirely
from deserters of all sorts when it came out to Portugal in
the spring of 1811. At absconding it was far worse than the
Brunswickers—the latter were raised from many races, but
at least they were not born Frenchmen as were the most
important section of the Chasseurs. A glance down the
names of the rank and file of the corps seems to show that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
after Frenchmen the next most important section were
Italians, and that there were a few Poles and some Swiss,
the latter supplying the men with Teutonic names. It
seems to have been the working rule with the officers who
accepted volunteers from the prison-camps to draft French
and Italians into the Chasseurs, while Germans of all sorts
went into the Legion or the Brunswick Corps, and Swiss
partly into the Chasseurs, partly into Watteville’s old Swiss
regiment: Poles and Croats went anywhere. Now a German
prisoner who volunteered into the British service might
do so from patriotic motives, and make an excellent soldier.
A Swiss or an Italian or an Illyrian could not be very
heavily blamed for desertion—he had been conscribed, and
sent to fight for Napoleon, in a quarrel that was not his
own. But the French deserter was no longer an old royalist,
like the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">emigré</i> soldiers of 1794, but one of two things.
Either he was a man who enlisted in the Chasseurs simply
to get a chance of deserting back to his own friends, or
else he was a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mauvais sujet</i>, a man without patriotic feeling
or morality, who was ready to fight against his own countrymen
for pay or plunder. Both classes were amply represented:
the former fled back to the French ranks when
they could, often taking valuable information with them.
The latter were the worst class of mercenaries, since they
had no inspiring cause to keep them true to their colours,
while individually they were for the most part bad characters
who had been the curse of their regiments while in the
French service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chasseurs Britanniques</div>

<p>The unenviable task of keeping together this body of
deserters and adventurers fell to a body of officers who
were almost without exception furious French royalists,
the second generation of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">emigrés</i>. They looked upon
the war with Bonaparte as a family feud, in which they
fought under any colours (many of their kin were in the
Russian or the Austrian, or the Spanish service) in order
to avenge the death of Louis XVI., the atrocities of the
Terror, or the Massacres of Quiberon. With old loyalty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
to the Bourbons, and personal hatred for the new French
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i> as their inspiration, they were fierce and desperate
fighters. They kept the miscellaneous horde committed
to their charge under an iron discipline, and used the lash
freely. All that their personal courage could accomplish
was done, to make the Chasseurs an efficient fighting force.
But they could not stop desertion, nor frequent misconduct.
The most astonishing court-martial in the war was that
held on October 5, 1812, upon no less than 18 Chasseurs
who had deserted in a body, two corporals and 16 men, of
whom all but two bore Italian names.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> This was only
the largest case of a constant series of defections. The
regiment melted away whenever it came near the French
lines, and Wellington had a standing order that it must
never be trusted with the outposts. Yet as a fighting
body it had no bad record—as witness Fuentes de Oñoro
and many other fields. This was the work of the zealous
service of its officers—and was indeed a wonderful <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tour de
force</i>. The material with which they had to work was
detestable.</p>

<p>These were the only foreign corps, strictly speaking, in
Wellington’s army, but there were two more units which
had a large, indeed a preponderating, German element in
them, though they were numbered in the British line.
These were the 5/60th, the rifle battalion of the “Royal
Americans,” and the 97th, a single-battalion corps which
started its existence as Stuart’s “Minorca Regiment,” but
got a place in the British line in 1804 as the “Queen’s
Germans.” Neither of these battalions were purely German
either in officers or men: of the 5/60th the disembarkation
roll on its original landing in Portugal shows eighteen officers
with German and ten with British names.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> The colonel, De
Rottenbourg, was a foreigner, but the second in command,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
Davy, an Englishman. The British element was not proportionally
so strong in the rank and file at the commencement
of the war, but was apparently increasing as it went
on. English and Irish recruits were drafted in, in order
that such a fine corps might not be spoilt with the bad
class of German recruit such as was alone procurable in
1812 or 1813. When the corps returned from the Peninsula
in 1814 it had only nine officers with German names and
twelve with British, and I fancy the balance in the rank
and file between the nationalities had changed in the same
way. When amalgamated with the 1/60th, after the end
of the war it had certainly 400 British to something under
300 Germans in its ranks.</p>

<p>This was a most distinguished corps: the green-coated
rifle companies which it supplied to many brigades of the
Peninsular Army were universally praised for their cool
courage and admirable marksmanship. The battalion had
very few deserters save for one period in 1808–9, when it
had received a batch of recruits from Junot’s Army of
Portugal, who proved unsatisfactory. It would be an
absolute insult to the 5/60th to class them with the Brunswickers
or the Chasseurs Britanniques.</p>

<p>The 97th being a single-battalion corps, with nothing
to maintain it but a depôt which could only collect German
recruits in the same fashion as the K.G.L., wasted down
to a very small remnant after two years of war, and was
sent back to England in 1811, with a handsome epitaph of
praise by Wellington. It never got to the front again,
remained at home on a very weak establishment, and was
disbanded at the end of the war. Like the 5/60th it was
not wholly German; among the officers we find individuals
with British names like Carter, Biscoe, Wilson, Lyon.
Its colonel and one of its two majors were English,
and there was a proportion of non-Germans among its
rank and file. Its Peninsular record if short was
distinguished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Portuguese Army in 1809</div>

<p>It remains to speak about the Portuguese, who formed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
about two-fifths of Wellington’s fighting force. We have
already had occasion to speak of the way in which they
were distributed among the British troops, when dealing
with the character of Beresford,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> and the composition of
the Peninsular divisions.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> But the inner mechanism of
the Portuguese army remains to be detailed. It consisted
in 1809 of twenty-four regiments of infantry of the line,
each of two battalions, save the 21st which had been cut
up at Soult’s storm of Oporto in March, and only mustered
one.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> There were also six light infantry battalions of
caçadores, all raised in 1808–9, and twelve weak regiments
of horse. The artillery, divided into four local regiments
of unequal strength (those of Lisbon, Oporto, Elvas, and
Algarve), supplied nine or ten field batteries, and a number
of garrison companies which manned the guns of Elvas,
Almeida, Abrantes, Peniche, and many other minor fortresses.
There was in addition an abnormal corps, the Loyal
Lusitanian Legion, raised by Sir Robert Wilson at Oporto in
1808, which furnished three battalions of light infantry, a
squadron of horse and an incomplete battery. This legion,
which had done very good service in 1809–10, was absorbed
into the regular army in 1811, its three battalions becoming
the 7th, 8th, and 9th caçadores. At the same time Wellington
ordered the raising of three new light battalions bearing
the numbers 10, 11, and 12.</p>

<p>The establishment of a Portuguese two-battalion line
regiment was nominally 1540 men, that of a caçador
battalion 770 men: they were each divided into six strong
companies. The cavalry regiments, with a nominal effective
of 590 men, seldom showed 300 apiece in the field. The
infantry corps, with the conscription to keep their ranks full,
could from 1809 onward generally take the field with over
1200 of all ranks, not including men in hospital or detached,
and very seldom shrank as low as 1000. The caçador
battalions were generally somewhat weaker in proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
to their nominal effective, rarely showing more than 500
men in line.</p>

<p>The organization of the Portuguese Army was made on
a strictly local basis, each of the twenty-four line regiments
having its proper recruiting district. Two corps were
furnished by the province of Algarve, five by the Alemtejo,
four by Lisbon city and its surrounding district, three by
the rest of Portuguese Estremadura, four by the Beira,
four by Oporto and the Entre-Douro-e-Minho, and two by
Tras-os-Montes.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> Some of the recruiting-districts being
less populous than others, had a greater difficulty in keeping
up their territorial regiments. This was especially the case
with the five corps of the Alemtejo, where the waste bears
a greater proportion to the inhabited land than in other
provinces of Portugal.</p>

<p>The caçador battalions were mainly raised in the better
peopled north, which supplied not only the three (Nos. 7,
8, 9), formed from the Lusitanian Legion (all raised in and
about Oporto), but also numbers 3, 4, 6, and after 1811 the
additional numbers 10, 11, 12. The southern provinces
only provided numbers 1, 2, 5. These brown and dark
green battalions, whose sombre colours contrasted strongly
with the bright blue and white of the Portuguese line,<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a>
supplied, along with the green British riflemen, the main
skirmishing line of Wellington’s army. Eight of the
twelve were raised and commanded by British officers, only
the remaining four by Portuguese colonels.</p>

<p>Portugal is not a country abounding in horses, and
of the twelve dragoon regiments of which its cavalry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
consisted, three (Nos. 2, 3, 12) were never put into the field
at all, but utilized as dismounted troops in garrison duty.
Of the other nine corps several were mere fragments, and
none ever took anything like its establishment of 500 sabres
to the front. Three hundred was as much as was usually
shown: in the 1811 campaign the two regiments which
Wellington used in the Fuentes de Oñoro campaign had
not 450 mounted men between them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beresford’s Work</div>

<p>Beresford’s conversion of the disorganized and depleted
army of which he took the command in 1809 into a serviceable
and well-disciplined force was a remarkable achievement.
He found it in a chaotic state—Junot had disbanded the
whole, save a few battalions which he sent to France to
serve Napoleon. The regiments had collected again as
best they could, but the cadres were incomplete, and the
corps of officers left much to be desired. The Portuguese
army before 1808 had all the typical faults of an army of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ancien régime</i> which had rusted in a long period of peace.
It was full of old or incapable officers put into place by court
intrigues or family influence. Promotion was irregular and
perfectly arbitrary; the lower commissioned ranks of the
regiments were choked with officers whose want of education
and military knowledge made them unfit for higher posts.
They had often grown grey as lieutenants, and were perfectly
useless in a crisis. The pay was very low, and the
temptation to make up for the want of it by petty jobbing
and embezzlement too strong.</p>

<p>When Beresford took command, in the early spring of
1809, he had found about 30,000 regular troops in arms
on an establishment which ought to have shown nearly
60,000. The deficiency in mere numbers could be remedied
by a stringent use of the conscription: but the deficiencies
of organization could not. Beresford complained that
“Long habits of disregard of duty, and consequent laziness,
made it not only difficult but almost impossible to induce
many senior officers to enter into any regular and continued
attention to the duties of their situations, and neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
reward nor punishment would induce them to bear up
against the fatigue.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> In the lower ranks there was a
good deal of zeal, there being great numbers of young
officers from the higher classes, who had just accepted
commissions from patriotic motives; but there was also a
heavy dead-weight of old and slack officers, and an appalling
want of professional knowledge.</p>

<p>Beresford made it a condition of accepting his post that
he should be allowed a free hand to retain, dismiss, or
promote, and should be permitted to introduce a certain
amount of British officers into the army. The Regency
granted his request, of necessity and not with enthusiasm.
He then proceeded to use his permission with great energy.
A vast number of old officers, both in the higher and lower
ranks, were put on half pay: only a minority of the colonels
and generals were retained on active service. All the
regiments which had been cursed with notoriously inefficient
commanders were placed in charge of British officers, of
whom four or five were drafted into every unit. Beresford’s
system was that “since national feeling required management,”
and “he must humour and satisfy the pride of the
nation,” a sufficient number of the higher places must be
left to natives, but each must have British officers either
immediately over or immediately under him. Where a
Portuguese general commanded a brigade, it was managed
that the colonels of his two regiments should both be
English. Where there was a Portuguese colonel, his senior
major was English; where an English colonel, his senior
major was Portuguese. In addition there were two, three,
or four British captains in each regiment, but hardly any
subalterns. For, to encourage good officers to volunteer
into the Portuguese service, it was provided that every
one doing so should receive a step in promotion, lieutenants
becoming captains, and captains majors. This system
seems to have worked well, though friction was bound to
occur, since the blow to Portuguese national pride, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
so many high posts were given to foreigners, was a
heavy one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Portuguese Officers</div>

<p>Yet according to those who had the working of the newly
organized army in their hands, the effect was very satisfactory.
“The Portuguese captains are piqued into
activity and attention, when they see their companies
excelled in efficiency by those under English, and do from
emulation what a sense of duty would never, perhaps,
bring them to. There are a variety of oblique means and
by-paths by which the parts of a Portuguese corps are
constantly, and almost insensibly, tending to return to their
old habits, to which they are so much attached. To nip
this tendency, from time to time, in the bud, it is necessary
to be aware of it: without the constant surveillance of
English subordinate officers (who ever mingling with the
mass of the men cannot but be aware of what is going on)
the commanding officer can rarely be warned in time.”<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a>
D’Urban, the author of this memorandum, adds that one
of his great difficulties was to secure that the junior officers
of the old noble families were kept up to their work. “Even
supposing a sufficient energy of character in a native officer,
he does not, and will not, unless he be a <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">fidalgo</i> himself,
exercise coercive or strong measures to oblige one of that
class to do his duty. He is aware that by doing so he will
make a powerful enemy, and all the habits of thought in
which he has been educated inspire him with such a dread
of this, that no sense of duty will urge him to encounter it.
Whenever a regiment is commanded by a non-<i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">fidalgo</i> it
never fails to suffer extremely: the noblemen are permitted
to do as they please, and set a very bad example.”
The only remedy was to see that any regiment where the
<i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">fidalgos</i> were numerous had an English colonel.</p>

<p>Such were the difficulties under which Beresford and
the body of picked British officers whom he selected as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
his subordinates built up the army, which by 1811 was
fit to take its place in battle line along with its allies, and
in 1812–14 did some of the most brilliant service of the
Peninsular War. Some of the exploits of the Portuguese
brigades hardly obtain in Napier’s history the prominence
that is their due. While he acknowledges the good service
of the Light Division caçadores at Bussaco and elsewhere,
there is scarcely praise enough given to Harvey’s brigade at
Albuera, who received and repulsed <em>in line</em> the charge of
Latour-Maubourg’s dragoons, a feat of which any British
troops would have been proud. And the desperate resistance
for many hours of Ashworth’s Portuguese at St. Pierre
near Bayonne is hardly noticed with sufficient gratitude—forming
the centre of Hill’s thin line, pressed upon by
overwhelming numbers, and with both flanks turned from
time to time, they fought out a whole long morning of
battle, and never gave way an inch, though their line was
reduced to a thin chain of skirmishers scattered along a
hedge and a coppice. The advance of the 13th and 24th
Portuguese at the storm of St. Sebastian, across a ford
200 yards wide and waist-deep, swept by artillery fire from
end to end, does however receive from Napier its due meed
of admiration. This was a great achievement—every
wounded man was doomed to drowning: on the other side
was the blazing breach, where the British assault had come
to a dead stop after dreadful slaughter, but the Portuguese
regiments won their way over the deadly water, and took
their share in the final assault with unflinching courage.</p>

<p>On the whole, the caçador battalions had the finest
record in the Portuguese Army, the cavalry the least satisfactory.
Some good work is recorded of them, <i>e.g.</i> the
charge of Madden’s squadrons saved the whole of La
Romana’s army at the combat of Fuente del Maestre in
1810, and that of D’Urban’s brigade gave efficient help to
Pakenham’s great flank attack at Salamanca in 1812.
But there were some “untoward incidents,” such as the
general bolt at the battle of the Gebora, and the panic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
at the combat of Majadahonda, just before Wellington’s
entry into Madrid. Of the last D’Urban writes,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> “My
poor fellows are still a most daily and uncertain sort of
fighting people. At Salamanca they followed me into the
enemy’s ranks like British dragoons; yesterday they were
so far from doing their duty that in the first charge they
just went far enough to land me in the enemy’s ranks. In the
second, which (having got them rallied) I rashly attempted,
I could not get them within 20 yards of the enemy—they
left me alone, and vanished before the French helmets like
leaves before the autumn wind. They require a little
incentive of shouts, and the inspiring cheers of a British
line advancing near them. I am afraid they will never be
quite <em>safe</em> by themselves, or in silence.” These are bitter
words, but the record of Majadahonda is not a creditable
one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Portuguese Militia</div>

<p>Of the Portuguese militia and the irregular levies of
the Ordenança it is not necessary to speak here at length.
They formed part of Wellington’s tools for carrying on the
war, but not of his army. For, excepting in the Lines of
Torres Vedras, he never put the militia side by side with
the regulars, but always left them out in the open country,
to watch frontiers or harass French lines of communication.
They were under strict orders not to fight—orders which
enterprising officers like Silveira and Trant sometimes
disobeyed, to their own sorrow. Their duty was to screen
the countryside against small French detachments, to
make the movement of the enemy save in large bodies
impossible, to capture convoys, or to cut off stragglers.
Their most brilliant exploit was the capture of Masséna’s
hospitals at Coimbra in 1810. More could not be expected
from levies only intermittently under arms, not furnished
with proper uniforms, and officered by civilians, or by the
inefficients weeded out of the regular army. They were a
valuable asset in Wellington’s hands, but not a real fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
force. Even far on in the war, so late as 1812, whole
brigades of them broke up in panic in face of a very small
force of cavalry—as at the unhappy combat of Guarda,
where Trant and Wilson tried to do too much with these
amateurs.</p>

<p>As to the ordenança or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">levée en masse</i>, it had not even
the organization of the militia, and was largely armed with
pikes for want of muskets. Its only duty was to infest
the countryside and prevent the enemy from foraging.
The French shot them as “brigands” whenever caught;
it was their natural practice to retaliate by making away
with all stragglers and marauders who fell into their
hands. Wellington offered a bounty for prisoners, but it
was not very often asked for, or paid.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV" class="vspace">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<span class="subhead">DISCIPLINE AND COURT-MARTIALS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the chapters that dealt with the officers and the men
of the Peninsular Army, we have had occasion to speak of
the percentage of undesirables that were to be found in
every rank, and of their special weaknesses and crimes. It
is necessary to explain the way in which the British military
code of the day dealt with them.</p>

<p>For the officers there was a long gradation of punishments,
ranging down from a simple reprimand to discharge
from the service with ignominy. For the non-commissioned
officers reduction to the ranks was the most
usual chastisement inflicted; but in cases of a particularly
disgraceful sort, the lash was not infrequently allotted as
an additional penalty. For the rank and file flogging was
the universal panacea; the amount of strokes might range
up from a minimum twenty-five strokes—which was a
mere nothing to the habitual offender, but a serious thing
for the good soldier who lost much of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">morale</i> when
once he had “gone to the halberds,” even for such a light
punishment. The maximum, a very unusual one, was
1200 strokes, an amount calculated to kill many men, and
to permanently disable many more. But this awful tale
of lashes was not very frequently awarded, being reserved
for bad cases of desertion to the enemy, robbery with
violence, or striking an officer, all of them offences which
might have had death as their punishment. As far as I can
count, 1200 lashes were only awarded nine or ten times by
general court-martial during the whole six years of the war.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
The hardly less severe sentence of 1000 lashes was given
more frequently—over 50 cases may be reckoned up—the
offences were the same as those which earned the still heavier
maximum amount. During the latter years of the war,
from 1811 onward, two additional forms of punishment for
very serious crimes were invented. The first, mainly
reserved for deserters who had not gone over to the enemy,
but had simply left the colours and hidden themselves in
the Peninsula, was long service in a colonial corps, such
as the African or the New South Wales Regiment. The
other, a much more severe sentence, was that of penal
servitude, either for a term of years (seven was the usual
period), or for life. The penal settlement to which the
convict was sent is generally stated, and is almost invariably
New South Wales. This sentence was generally awarded
for cases of repeated desertion (not to the enemy) and
habitual theft without violence. The moment that violence
was added to robbery, the offender came within a near
distance of the gallows or of the much-dreaded 1000 lashes—which
often had the same meaning in the end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cashiering of Officers</div>

<p>It may be interesting to give some account of the various
causes for which an officer might incur the heaviest penalty
that could be laid on him—to be cashiered. This sentence
was awarded some thirty times during the war. Twice
only was it the reward of shirking or cowardice. In three
or four cases it was inflicted for swindling merchants; in
as many more for embezzling public money or stores.
Five or six were instances of insulting or openly disobeying
a commanding officer. Three or four cashierings were the
direct result of drink—the offender having been found
intoxicated and incapable while on duty in a responsible
position. The most repulsive case of the whole list was
one where drunkenness was the indirect, but not the actual,
cause of disgrace. Three young officers, at the break up
of a debauch, found the corpse of a priest lying in state
in a room in the quarters where two of them were lodged.
They mishandled it, and cast it forth, stripping off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
vestments, and breaking the candles, etc., with which it
was laid out.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> This disgusting freak, apparently caused by
drunken resentment at finding a corpse in close proximity
to their bedroom, drew down a commentary from Wellington
as to the noxious effects of drink—which not only makes
men incapable of performing their duty, but renders them
“unaware of the nature or effect of their actions.”</p>

<p>The remaining cases of cashiering were for such offences
as public and disgraceful brawling, violently resisting
arrest, and flagrant immorality.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> There is just one case
of dismissal from the service for tyranny—that of a colonel
who habitually bullied his officers and inflicted arbitrary
and illegal punishments on his men.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> Of this I shall have
to say more in its place.</p>

<p>All the thirty cashierings cited above are those of
combatant officers. There are about an equal number of
cases in which persons employed under the civil departments
of the army were dismissed the service—commissaries,
purveyors, surgeons, hospital mates, etc. In the commissariat
department (as might have been foreseen) embezzlement
was the snare to unscrupulous men, often far
from the eye of their superior—it was too easy to issue
false vouchers as to the number of men or horses rationed,
or to make corrupt agreements with contractors or local
authorities, certifying that a larger amount of food or forage
had been supplied than had really been given in. Selling
public mules or horses, and returning them as dead, was
another profitable fraud. Two non-combatant employés
of the army (a paymaster and a conductor of stores) were
“broken” for absconding from the army during the battle
of Talavera, and spreading false reports of disaster in the

<p>The medical staff, not nearly such frequent offenders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
as the commissariat staff, are occasionally dismissed the
service for brawling and drunkenness, which last inevitably
resulted in the neglect of the wounded on the march or in
hospital.</p>

<p>After cashiering, the next most serious punishment
inflicted on an officer was suspension from pay and rank for
a term of months, six and three were the usual periods
named. This might be inflicted for any one of a great
variety of offences. By far the most frequent fault was
neglect of details of duty, such as quitting the regiment or
detachment for many hours without leave, allowing a convoy
or a draft to straggle, permitting the rank and file to pull
down cottages for firewood, or to waste crops, or to fell
fruit trees. Sleeping away from the company, in a rather
distant house or village, was another frequent misdemeanour.
We may place second in the category of offences the one
that may be called quarrelling with native authorities.
Owing to high-handed action on the one side, and provocative
sulkiness on the other, these wrangles were very
common. Officers in charge of detachments fell out with
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">juiz de fora</i> or a <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">corregidor</i>, or the governor of some petty
garrison, about billets or payments due, and ended by
insulting, occasionally by assaulting, him. This generally
cost the offender six months’ suspension, for Wellington
was resolved that the officers of his army must not override
lawful local authority, and sometimes, in his comments on
a court-martial sentence, asks what would be thought of a
lieutenant who should treat in such a fashion the mayor
of an English borough, or the commandant of an English
fort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington and Petty Quarrels</div>

<p>The third list of offences which were usually visited
with shorter or longer “suspension” may be put together
under the general head of relations of officers to each other.
This includes equally oppressive or insulting acts of superiors
to inferiors, and insubordinate conduct of inferiors to
superiors. The latter was far the more common failing,
if the statistics of court-martials may be trusted. But no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
doubt allowance must be made for many cases in which a
bullied subaltern preferred to hold his tongue, rather than
to appeal against the acts or language of his captain or
colonel—the failure of his case would leave him in a very
dangerous and unpleasant position for the future. Intemperate
language, or “improper” letters from inferiors
to superiors, are a not uncommon cause of court-martials.
Even colonels occasionally wrote or spoke in insubordinate
terms to generals.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> But “answering back” on the part
of subalterns to captains or majors was of course far more
frequent. Wellington grew, on occasion, exceedingly
wrath at reading the reports of court-martials on petty
cases of this kind. We may give a typical comment.</p>

<p>“I cannot but consider the transaction which has been
the subject of this court-martial as simply a private quarrel,
it has as little connection with the public service or the
discipline and subordination of the army, as any that has
ever come under my notice. It is certainly true that the
private quarrels of officers may be proper subjects for the
investigation of a court-martial. But the complainant, in
order to obtain a decision in his favour, must come with a
fair case. He must not himself have been guilty of any
breach of the general order of the army, or of discipline.
His authority as a superior must not have been exerted
over his inferior (of whom he complains) in order to enjoy
the advantage of his own improper conduct. Above all,
he must have refrained from the use of abusive or improper
language and gestures.”<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></p>

<p>Another comment <span class="locked">is—</span></p>

<p>“The Commander of the Forces cannot but feel that both
his time, and that of the officers composing court-martials,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
is occupied very little to the advantage of the public service,
in considering the unbecoming and ungentlemanlike behaviour
of officers to each other.”<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></p>

<p>The mildest form of punishment for officers was the
reprimand, which varied much in shape. It might amount
to no more than the publication of the fact that an officer
<em>was</em> reprimanded in the General Orders, without any further
publicity. Or, on the other hand, the sentence of the court-martial
might be directed to be read out to his regiment,
or even to his division, in the most public fashion. And
to the sentence there might be added a caustic and scathing
postscript by the Commander-in-Chief. Take, for example,
“This person may think himself very fortunate that the
sentence of the court has been so lenient. A different
view of the evidence on the charge would have rendered
his dismissal from the service necessary under the Articles
of War. The Commander of the Forces hopes that he will
take warning by what has occurred, and will in future
conduct himself on all occasions as a gentleman should.
This reprimand is to be read to him by the commanding
officer at the station where he may happen to be, in presence
of the officers and troops, paraded for that purpose.”<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<p>Reprimands were generally the punishment for the
smaller derelictions of duty, such as failing to report arrival
at a station, striking a soldier who was insolent instead of
arresting him, brawling with a civilian or a Portuguese
militia officer, or boisterous and unseemly conduct in the
streets when off duty.</p>

<p>There was no court-martial on an officer for desertion
during the whole war, and only one case of the sort in the
commissioned ranks. This was that of an Irish lieutenant
who passed over to the French outposts while Masséna’s
army was lying behind the lines of Santarem in February,
1811. He was discovered to be insane or suffering from
delusions, being captured during Masséna’s retreat, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
wandering in an objectless way in the rear of the enemy’s
march: he was sent to a mad-house.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Executions for Desertion</div>

<p>As to the punishments of the soldier, the heaviest was
death, either by the bullets of a firing party, or by the
Provost Marshal’s gallows. Shooting was almost exclusively
reserved for the military offence of desertion to the
enemy; but it was two or three times awarded for mutiny
and striking an officer or sergeant, and once only (as far as
I can make out) to a non-commissioned officer for robbing
valuable stores which he had been set to guard.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> It would
have been more usual to hang for the latter offence, and
I do not know why this particular case was punished with
shooting. There seem to have been 78 men shot in all
during the war, of whom 52 were British, and 26 foreigners.
The disproportion, of course, is enormous, as there were
some fifty or sixty British battalions in the army, and only
ten foreign battalions.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> Among the last the main body
of deserters were supplied by two battalions only, the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Chasseurs Britanniques</i> and Brunswick Oels Jägers, both
of which corps were largely recruited, as has been already
explained, from Germans, Italians, Poles, and other aliens
from prison camps at home. They had volunteered into the
British service in order to get the chance of escape, and took
it at the first opportunity. The deserters from the King’s
German Legion were in proportion very few. During the
last two years of the war many of these foreign deserters
were not shot, but given life service in a colonial corps,
in places such as New South Wales, from which they could
not desert again. Some others got off with a heavy sentence
of flogging.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Punishment of Hanging</div>

<p>Hanging was the penalty for practically all capital
offences except desertion to the enemy. It was not so frequent
as shooting. The records of the General Court-Martials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
show a total of about forty executions, and a few more
were apparently carried out by the Provost Marshal on
criminals caught <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">flagrante delicto</i> murdering or wounding
peasants.</p>

<p>The punishment of hanging covered many offences. It
is rather surprising to find that two men who killed their
officers (one in the Buffs, one in the 42nd) were hanged
rather than shot—but apparently each case was ruled to
be one of private spite, and not of mutiny, and was treated
as simple murder. There were six or eight instances of
men who slew a comrade in the ranks, by deliberate assassination,
not in a quarrel, and were hanged for it. It may
be noted, however, that one private who stabbed an unfaithful
wife, at the moment of detection, was found guilty
of manslaughter and given one year’s imprisonment only.
Far the most frequent cause for the use of the gallows,
however, was the killing or wounding of peasants who
attempted to defend their houses or cattle from plunder.
This was a crime for which Wellington seldom if ever gave
pardon; he was as inflexible on the point in the hostile land
of France as in the friendly Spain and Portugal. It did
not matter whether the peasants were killed or not—the
use of musket or bayonet against them in pursuit of plunder
was the thing that mattered. There are certainly some
most atrocious cases in the list, where a whole family had
been murdered or left for dead. But in others, where the
violence had been no more than a blow with a butt-end, or
a bayonet prod in the shoulder, the offenders seem to have
been unlucky in not getting off with a sound flogging.
But in Wellington’s code petty stealing without violence
was punished with the lash, but armed robbery with death.</p>

<p>In an age when in England theft to the value of over
forty shillings was still punishable in theory with death,
(though the penalty was more often evaded than not), it is
not surprising to find that some of the cases of hanging in
Wellington’s army were for mere stealing. But it was
always for stealing on a large scale, or under aggravated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
circumstances. Mere petty larceny led to the lash only.
The most notable achievement in this line was that of
two foreigners who succeeded in breaking open the commissary-general’s
chest and stole no less than £2000 from
it; others were those of a soldier-servant who absconded
with his master’s mule, baggage, and purse; of a sentry
over the tent of a brigadier, who took the opportunity of
making off with the general’s silver camp-equipage and
plate; and of a man who being on treasure-escort, succeeded
in opening a barrel and stealing some hundreds of
dollars from it. In two or three instances large sums of
£40 or £60, burglariously stolen from the house or tent of
an officer, a commissary, or a sutler, brought men to the
gallows. Finally, there was one case of hanging for the
crime of sodomy—which was still a capital offence in
English law for more than thirty years after the Peninsular
War ended.</p>

<p>There are one or two instances on record of rather surprising
leniency in the sentences inflicted by court-martial
for crimes which in most other cases entailed the death-penalty—<i>e.g.</i>
plundering and wounding a peasant was on
two occasions in 1814 punished with 900 and 1000 lashes
only, and three artillerymen, who stole the watch, purse,
and papers of the Spanish General Giron, got off with
transportation to New South Wales, instead of suffering
the hanging that was usual for such a serious offence. A
dragoon convicted of rape in 1814 was lucky also in
receiving no more than a heavy flogging. No doubt there
was in such light sentences some consideration of previous
good conduct and steady service on the part of the
offenders.</p>

<p>We have already spoken of the penalties which came
next after death in the list—the terrible 1200 and 1000
lash awards, and of the crimes which usually earned them.
Much more frequent were the 700, 500, and 300 lash sentences,
which are to be numbered by the hundred, and
were awarded, as a rule, for casual theft without violence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
making away with necessaries (<i>e.g.</i> selling blankets or
ball-cartridge to peasants), or “embargoing” carts and
oxen, <i>i.e.</i> pressing transport from the countryside without
leave, to carry baggage or knapsacks when a small party,
without an officer in charge, was on the move. Purloining
shoes or food from a convoy was another frequent offence,
worth about 500 lashes to the detected culprit. The bee-hive
stealers of the retreat from Talavera got 700 lashes
each—a heavy sentence for such a crime. The tale concerning
them is too good to be omitted.</p>

<p>After the general order against plundering from the
peasantry was issued at Jaraicejo to the half-starved army,
Sir Arthur Wellesley, in a cross-country ride, saw a man
of the Connaught Rangers posting along as fast as his legs
could carry him, with his great coat wrapped around his
head, and a bee-hive balanced upon it, with a swarm of
furious bees buzzing around. Furious at such a flagrant
breach of orders issued only on the previous day, the
Commander-in-Chief called out to him, “Hullo, sir, where
did you get that bee-hive?” Pat could not see his interlocutor,
having completely shrouded his face to keep off
stings: he did not pay sufficient heed to the <em>tone</em> of the
question, which should have warned him, and answered
in a fine Milesian brogue, “Just over the hill there, and,
by Jasus, if ye don’t make haste they’ll be all gone.”<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> The
blind good-nature of the reply stayed the General’s anger;
he let Pat pass, and told the story at dinner with a laugh.
But the order was no joke to the men of the 53rd caught
at the same game a few days after.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> They got the nickname
of the “honeysuckers” along with their flogging.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Charles Reilly’s Excuse</div>

<p>There is another tale of “embargoing” belonging to
the regimental history of the Connaught Rangers, which
may serve as a pendant to that about the bee-hives.</p>

<p>Early in 1812 a commissary had pressed country carts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
to go to the Douro, to bring back pipes of wine for the
troops. On such occasions, with a hilly country and very
tedious work, the men would often contrive, in spite of the
vigilance of the subaltern in charge of the convoy, to let
the driver escape with his bullocks for a pecuniary consideration.
Other carts were then illegally pressed as
substitutes. On one of these occasions a detachment of
the 88th regiment was sent to St. João da Pesqueira for
some wine. On their return, the commissary observed
that the two fine white bullocks, which he had sent with
one cart, had been exchanged for two very inferior blacks.
He made his regular complaint, and the two men in charge,
a corporal and private, were brought to a court-martial.
On the trial everything was proved, save the act of receiving
money from the driver to allow the white bullocks to escape;
and the president, on summing up the evidence of the
commissary, said to the prisoners, “It is quite useless denying
the fact; it is conclusive. You started from hence
with a pair of fine white bullocks, and you brought back
a pair of lean blacks. What can you have to say to that?”
Private Charles Reilly, noways abashed at this, which every
one thought a poser, and ready with any excuse to save
himself from punishment, immediately exclaimed, “Och!
plaise your honour, and wasn’t the white beasts lazy, and
didn’t we bate them until they were black?” The court
was not quite satisfied of the truth of this wonderful metamorphosis,
and they were condemned to be punished (<em>see</em>
General Order, Freneda, January 22, 1812)—the corporal to
be broke and get 700 lashes, Reilly to get 500. But in
consideration of the great gallantry displayed by the 88th
at the storm of Ciudad Rodrigo a few days before, the
culprits were in the end pardoned.</p>

<p>All these cases quoted are from records of general court-martials.
But of course the huge majority of floggings
were inflicted by regimental courts, which had jurisdiction
over all minor offences, such as drunkenness, disobedience,
and petty breaches of discipline inside the regiment, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
could not give the heavier sentences such as death or
transportation, or the 1000 lashes.</p>

<p>A glance through the records of court-martials shows
that some battalions gave much more than their proper
percentage of criminals, some much less. Two main causes
governed the divergence: the first was that some corps
got more than their share of bad recruits—wild Irish or
town scum; but I fancy that the character of the commanding
officer was even more important than the precise
proportion of undesirables drafted into the ranks. A
colonel who could make himself loved as well as feared
could reclaim even very unpromising recruits: a tyrant
or an incapable could turn even well-disposed men into
bad soldiers. It is clear that an excessively easy-going
and slack commanding officer, who winked at irregularities,
and discouraged zeal among his officers, ruined a battalion
as surely as the most inhuman martinet. Among the court-martials
of the Peninsular Army there are very few on
colonels—not half a dozen. But one chances to be on a
tyrant, and the other on a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fainéant</i>, and the evidence seems
to show that the latter got his corps into quite as wretched
condition as the former. Though he received over the
regiment, as every one allowed, in excellent order, in a few
months of slack administration and relaxed discipline, it
became not only drunken and slovenly, but so slow on the
march, and at the rendezvous, that the other units in the
brigade had always to be waiting for it, and the brigadier
complained that he could not trust it at the outposts.
The officers, gradually coming to despise their colonel,
treated him with contempt, and finally sent in a round-robin
to the Horse Guards, accusing him not only of incapacity
but of cowardice, which last, in the court-martial
which followed, was held to be an unfounded charge.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> The
colonel, as a result of the investigation, was reprimanded,
and put on half-pay; his subordinates, for grave breach of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
discipline, were all drafted into other regiments, and a new
body of picked officers was brought together, to reorganize
a corps which was evidently in a thoroughly demoralized
condition; the new-comers got the nickname of the
“Elegant Extracts.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Tyrannical Colonel</div>

<p>The reverse-picture, of a regiment ruined by arbitrary
strictness and inhuman exaggeration of punishments, may
be studied in the records of a court-martial held in the
spring of 1813.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> In this case a commanding officer was
found guilty not only of “violent conduct” and “using
intemperate and improper language to his officers, being
in breach of good discipline, and unbecoming the character
of an officer and a gentleman,” but of inflicting corporal
punishment at large without any form of trial, when there
were sufficient officers present to form a proper regimental
court-martial; of disobeying the direction of the Commander-in-Chief
by piling up sentences of flogging passed
on men on different occasions, so as to inflict several separate
punishments at the same time, and of releasing men sentenced
to punishment in order to send them into action,
and then returning them to arrest after the battle in order
to receive their lashes. This last was specially in conflict
with Wellington’s orders, for he held that good conduct in
action ought to work out a sentence, pronounced but not
inflicted, and that no man convicted of a disgraceful offence
ought to be put into line till he had expiated it by undergoing
his punishment. This officer was dismissed the
service, but, in consideration of a good fighting record in
the past, was allowed the value of his commission as
major.</p>

<p>One diary from the ranks, that of Donaldson of the
94th, gives a very interesting and complete picture of the
fate of a battalion which, by the invaliding of its colonel,
had fallen into the hands of a major who had the soul of a
tyrant. This was a case of an old ranker who knew too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
much of soldiers’ tricks, and had a sort of system of espionage
through men who were prepared to act as his toadies and
secret informers. “By this eaves-dropping he knew all
the little circumstances which another commanding officer
would have disdained to listen to, and always made a bad
use of his knowledge. When he got command of the
regiment he introduced flogging for every trivial offence,
and in addition invented disgraceful and torturing modes
of inflicting the lash. But this was not enough—he ordered
that all defaulters should have a patch of black and yellow
cloth sewed on to the sleeve of their jacket, and a hole cut
in it for every time they were punished. The effect was
soon visible: as good men were liable to be punished for
the slightest fault, the barrier between them and hardened
ill-doers was broken down, and those who had lost respect
in their own eyes became broken-hearted and inefficient
soldiers, or else grew reckless and launched out into real
crime. Those who were hardened and unprincipled before,
being brought by the prevalence of punishments nearer to
a level with the better men, seemed to glory in misconduct.
In short, all idea of honour and character was lost, and
listless apathy and bad conduct became the prevailing
features of the corps. Reckless punishment changed the
individual’s conduct in two ways—he either became broken-hearted
and useless, or else shameless and hardened....
The real method of accomplishing the desired end of keeping
good discipline, is for the officers to make themselves
acquainted with the personal character and disposition of
each man under their command. A commanding officer
has as good a right to make himself acquainted with the
disposition of his men, as the medical officer with their
constitutions.”<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> When the colonel came back from sick
leave he was shocked to find the men he had been so proud
of treated in this manner. His first act was to cut off the
yellow badge; his second to do away with the frequent
punishments. But though the regiment was again on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
fair footing, it was long before the effect of a few months’
ill-usage disappeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Good-Conduct Medals</div>

<p>What certain misguided officers tried to maintain by a
reign of terror, was sought in other ways by wiser men.
It is to the Peninsular War period that we owe the first
of our “Long Service and Good Conduct” medals—all at
first regimental, and not given by the State. Honorary
distinctions for the well-conducted man are both a more
humane and a more rational form of differentiation between
good and bad than the black and yellow badge for every
man punished for any cause, which the detestable major
quoted above tried to introduce.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> In addition some
regiments instituted a division of the men into classes, of
which the best behaved had graduated privileges and
benefits. Any man after a certain period of certified good
conduct could be moved up into a higher class, and the
emulation not to be left among the recognized black-sheep
had a very good effect.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> But even without “classes” or
good-conduct medals, the best could be got out of any
regiment by wise and considerate conduct on the part of
the officers. There were corps where the lash was practically
unknown,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> and others where it had only been felt by a very
small minority of hopeless irreclaimables.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is a record or two of punishments
in a unit, inflicted by officers who do not seem to
have been regarded by public opinion as specially tyrannical
or heartless, which fills the reader with astonishment. I
have analysed the list of men noted for chastisement in
one battery of artillery, where on an effective of 4 sergeants
and 136 rank and file, three of the former had been “broken,”
and 57 of the latter had received punishments varying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
downwards from 500 lashes, in the space of twelve months
(July, 1812, to July, 1813), over which the record extends.
Though some of the offences were serious enough, there
were others for which the use of the cat appears altogether
misplaced and irrational. As an observer in another corps
wrote “the frequency of flogging at one time had the effect
of blinding the judgment of officers who possessed both
feeling and discrimination. I have known one who shed
tears when his favourite horse was injured, and next day
exulted in seeing a poor wretch flogged whose offence was
being late in delivering an order.”</p>

<p>Floggings were inflicted by the drummers of the regiment,
under the superintendence of the drum-major and the
adjutant. The culprit was bound by his extended arms
to two of three sergeants’ halberds, planted in the ground in
a triangle, and lashed together at the top. The strokes were
inflicted at the tap of a drum beaten in slow time. Each
of the wielders of the cat retired after having given twenty-five
lashes. The surgeon was always present, to certify
that the man’s life was not in danger by the further continuance
of the punishment, and the prisoner was taken
down the moment that the medical man declared that he
could stand no more. Often this interference saved a culprit
from the end of his punishment, as if the tale was fairly
complete he might never be called upon to undergo the
balance. But in grave cases the prisoner was merely sent
into hospital till he was sufficiently convalescent to endure
the payment of the remainder of his account. Inhuman
commanding officers sometimes refused to allow of any
abatement, even when the crime had not been a very
serious one, and insisted that the whole sentence should be
executed, even if the culprit had to go twice into hospital
before it was completed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Memory of a Flogging</div>

<p>The autobiographical record of a flogging is rather
rare—the diarist in the ranks was generally a steady sort
of fellow, who did not get into the worst trouble. The
following may serve as an example, however. It is that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
William Lawrence of the 1/40th, who in 1809 was a private,
though he won his sergeant’s stripes in 1813.</p>

<p>“I absented myself without leave from guard for
twenty-four hours, and when I returned I found I was in a
fine scrape, for I was immediately put in the guard-room.
It was my first offence, but that did not screen me much,
and I was sentenced to 400 lashes. I found the regiment
assembled all ready to witness my punishment: the place
chosen for it was the square of a convent. As soon as I
had been brought up by the guard, the sentence of the
court-martial was read over to me by the colonel, and I was
told to strip, which I did firmly, and without using the
help that was offered me, as I had by that time got hardened
to my lot. I was then lashed to the halberds, and the
colonel gave the order for the drummers to commence,
each one having to give me twenty-five lashes in turn.
I bore it very well until I had received 175, when I got so
enraged with the pain that I began pushing the halberds,
which did not stand at all firm (being planted on stones),
right across the square, amid the laughter of the regiment.
The colonel, I suppose thinking then that I had had sufficient,
‘ordered the sulky rascal down’ in those very words.
Perhaps a more true word could not have been spoken,
for indeed I was sulky. I did not give vent to a sound the
whole time, though the blood ran down my trousers from
top to bottom. I was unbound, and a corporal hove my
shirt and jacket over my shoulder, and convoyed me to
hospital, presenting as miserable a picture as I possibly
could.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was as good a thing for me as could then
have happened, as it prevented me from committing
greater crimes, which might at last have brought me to
my ruin. But I think a good deal of that punishment might
have been abandoned, with more credit to those who then
ruled the army.”<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> Yet to be absent twenty-four hours when
on guard was certainly a serious crime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
Lawrence got off with 175 lashes out of 400 ordered,
but was in hospital nearly three weeks. But 300 or 400
lashes were often inflicted at a time, and there were men
who could take them without a groan.</p>

<p>“Corporal punishment was going on all the year round,”
writes a veteran officer of the 34th,<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> “men were flogged for
the small offences, and for the graver ones often flogged to
death—the thousand lashes were often awarded by court-martial.
I have seen men suffer 500 and even 700 before
being ‘taken down,’ the blood running down into their
shoes, and their backs flayed like raw red-chopped sausages.
Some of them bore this awful punishment without flinching
for 200 or 300 lashes, chewing a musket ball or a bit of
leather to prevent or stifle the cry of agony: after that
they did not seem to feel the same torture. Sometimes the
head drooped over to one side, but the lashing still went
on, the surgeon in attendance examining the patient from
time to time to see what more he could bear. I <em>did</em> see,
with horror, one prisoner receive the 700 before he was
taken down. This was the sentence of a court-martial,
carried into effect in the presence of the whole brigade, for
an example.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> We certainly had very bad characters sent
out to fill the gaps in our ranks, sweepings of prisons in
England and Ireland: but such punishments were inhuman,
and I made up my mind that, if ever I had the chance of
commanding a regiment, I would act on another principle.
That time <em>did</em> come. I <em>did</em> command a gallant corps for
eleven years, and I abolished the lash.”</p>

<p>But enough of such horrors. The memory of them is
a nightmare.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE ARMY ON THE MARCH</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is rare in Peninsular literature to find any general
descriptions of the normal working of the military machine.
In personal diaries or reminiscences the author takes for
granted a knowledge of the daily life of the army, which
was so familiar to himself, and only makes remarks or notes
when something abnormal happened. Official documents,
on the other hand, are nearly always concerned with changes
or modifications in routine. They explain and comment
upon the reasons why some particular detail of practice
must be abandoned, or be more strictly enforced, but they
do not give descriptive accounts of the whole system of
which that detail is a part. A notion as to the methods on
which Wellington’s army was moved could be got together
by the comparison of a great many of his “General Orders.”
But, fortunately, we are spared much trouble in the compilation
of such a sketch by the fact that, for once, it is
possible to lay one’s hand on a careful detailed narrative of
how the army marched. It is to be found in the anonymous
introduction to the second edition of <cite>Selected General
Orders</cite>, which Gurwood published in 1837. It was
apparently not by the editor himself, as he states in his
introductory note that it “was written, as a critique, at the
suggestion of the author of a distinguished periodical
review; but being found too long and too professional
for columns usually destined to literature or politics, it was
not inserted.”<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> Since authors do not review their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
books, it is clear that this critique was written by some
friend, not by Gurwood himself. It extends to about
thirty-seven pages, of which nine are devoted to the long
and interesting sketch of Wellington’s army on the march,
which is reproduced in the following paragraphs. The author,
writing for the general public, not for the professional
public, tells us precisely what we want to know.</p>

<p>“The orders for movement from the Commander of the
Forces were communicated by the Quarter Master General
to the General Officers commanding divisions, who detailed
them, through their Assistant Quarter Master Generals, to
the Generals of brigades, who gave them out immediately
to the battalions of their brigades, through the Brigade
Majors. The drum, the bugle and the trumpet sounded the
preparation for the march at a certain hour, generally one
hour and a half before daylight, in order that the several
battalions might be assembled on the brigade alarm-posts,
so as to be ready to march off from the ground precisely at
daylight. It must be observed that the alarm-post is the
place of assembly in the event of alarm; it was generally,
and should always be, the place of parade.</p>

<p>“It is singular to refer to these orders to see how a
division of 6000 men, and so on in any proportion, rolled
up in their blankets ‘in the arms of Murphy,’ were all
dressed, with blankets rolled, packed, equipped, squadded,
paraded in companies, told off in subdivisions, sections,
and sections of threes, marched by companies to the
regimental alarm-posts, and finally to that of the brigade,
formed in close columns, all by sounds as familiar to the
soldier as the clock at the Horse Guards to a corporal of the
Blues. Guns were paraded, baggage packed and loaded,
Commissariat mules with the reserve biscuit, the Storekeeper
with the spare ammunition-bullocks placed under
charge, all assembled with the same precision and order,
ready to march off under the direction of the Assistant
Quarter Master General attached to the division or corps,
who had previously assembled the guides, whom he attached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
to the column or columns directed to be marched to the
points or towns named in the Quarter Master General’s
instructions. In the mean time the formidable Provost
Marshal attached to the division made his patrols.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Starting the March</div>

<p>“The report of ‘All Present’ being made in succession
by the Brigade Majors to the Assistant Adjutant General,
and by him to the General commanding the column, the
word ‘By sections of threes, march,’ was given, from the
right or left, as directed in the Quarter Master General’s
instructions, the whole being formed either right or left in
front, according to the views of the General in command of
the army. The advanced guard of the column was then
formed under the superintendence of the Brigade Major
of the Brigade, right or left in front. This advanced guard
consisted of one company of varying strength. The whole
was marched off at sloped arms, with the greatest precision
and regularity, and remained in that order until the word
‘March at ease’ was given to the leading battalion, which
was successively taken up by the others in the rear. The
women, in detached parties, either preceded the column or
followed it—none were permitted to accompany it; they
generally remained with the baggage, excepting when their
finances enabled them to make little speculations in bread
and <em>comfort</em> in the villages or towns in the neighbourhood
of the line of march. The Assistant Provost Marshal with
his guard and delinquents brought up the rear of the column,
followed by the rear guard, under an officer who took up
all the stragglers, whom he lodged in the main guard on his
arrival, where those who had received tickets of permission
to fall out were directed to join their corps, non-commissioned
officers being in waiting to receive them.</p>

<p>“The first halt was generally made at the expiration of
half an hour from the departure, and afterwards once an
hour; each halt lasted at least five minutes after the men
had piled their arms; this might vary a little, as the
weather, distance, or other circumstances of the march
might point out. The object of halting was for the purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
of allowing those who had fallen out to rejoin their companies,
which, excepting in cases of sickness, usually occurred;
as a man wanting to fall out was obliged to obtain a ticket
from the officer commanding his company so to do, and to
leave his pack and his firelock to be carried by his comrades
of his section of threes; he therefore lost no time to return
to his rank, and give back his ticket. This first halt was
generally passed in eating a piece of bread or meat set aside
for the march—arranging the accoutrements, pack, haversack,
and canteen, so as to sit well—in jokes about the last
night’s quarters or bivouac, or in the anticipations of the
next. At the expiration of the halt the drum or bugle
sounded the ‘Fall-in,’ and, by word of command, the
leading battalion proceeded in the same order as in the
beginning of the march; the other battalions following in
succession, always with music; then ‘March at ease’ as
before; but when the word ‘Attention’ was given, the
whole sloped arms and marched in the same order as at a
field-day; this was always done in formations previous to
the halt.</p>

<p>“When the army was not near the enemy, two officers
preceded each battalion on its march, one of them twenty-four
hours before the battalion, and, on his arrival at the
station pointed out, received the necessary information
from the Assistant Quarter Master General. The other
officer marched the same day in charge of the camp-colour
men of each company, so as to arrive early, and take
over the quarters from the officer who went on the day
before.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Distribution of Billets</div>

<p>“The Deputy Assistant Quarter Master General always
preceded these officers, to make arrangements with the
magistrates as to quarters: and the town was parcelled
out by him, in proportion to the strength of the several
battalions or corps, to their respective officers; they
divided it according to their judgment to the ten orderlies,
who chalked on the doors the letter of the company and
number of men to occupy, as also the officers’ quarters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
which invariably were in the quarters of the company.
The officer first marked off the quarters of the Commanding
Officer, staff, orderly-room, guard-room, Quarter Master’s
stores, all in the most central position in the quarters of the
regiment. The first officer then proceeded to the next
station; the second officer and the ten orderlies proceeded
to the road by which the troops were to arrive, and accompanied
them to the alarm-post fixed for them: which spot
the Assistant Quarter Master General, under the direction
of the General in command, had pointed out, either in front
or in rear of the town. Here they halted in column, as also
assembled the following morning, or at any other time that
the alarm or assembly might be sounded. The brigades,
the battalions, and the companies each had their respective
alarm-posts or places of formation in the most central parts
of their quarters. The officers commanding companies
then put their men up, and made reports to the Officer
Commanding as to the accommodation, or the want of it,
the officers commanding battalions to those commanding
brigades, and the Generals of Brigades to the General of
the Division. The Assistant Quarter Master General was
always ready to be appealed to, in case of a battalion being
crowded, to afford further accommodation, as there was
generally some building or street reserved in a central
position for this purpose, or in the event of detachments
of other corps arriving.</p>

<p>“When the column was to bivouac in huts, or, as afterwards,
encamp in tents, there occurred less difficulty. On
arrival on the position pointed out in the Quarter Master
General’s instructions, the General commanding chose what
he considered the most favourable ground in accordance
with needs as to front, communications with his flanks and
rear, reference to wood and water, and the health of the
ground, avoiding proximity to marshes, where the night
damps might affect the troops. The Assistant Quarter
Master General disposed of this ground to the several
officers sent on in advance by the battalions for that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
purpose, as before described in quarters. The General then
proceeded to the front, and indicated where he wished his
advanced piquets to be posted, to be in communication
with the outposts of the cavalry in front, or, if there were
none, to cover all the approaches with detached posts and
sentries, so that nothing should be able to arrive by any
of them without being seen and stopped; or if patrols or
other movements of the enemy should take place, either
by night or day, that the same might be made known by
the chain of sentries to the detached posts and outlying
piquets, and communicated to the main body, if thought
necessary, by the Field Officer of the outlying piquets.
Preconcerted signals of setting fire to beacons, or a certain
number of musket shots fired, communicated the alarm
more quickly, and allowed the troops more time to get under
arms, until the precise cause of the alarm was ascertained.</p>

<p>“The division having arrived on its ground, the outlying
piquets were immediately marched off to take the
covering of the front just described. The temporary
division-hospital, and the Commissariat magazines, being
pointed out to the Commanding Officers, Surgeons, and
Quarter Masters, the brigades and battalions proceeded to
their respective alarm-posts and ground for the encampment
or bivouac, accompanied by the officers and the
camp-colour men as before stated. The quarter and rear
guards were then mounted, to be relieved always in two
hours afterwards by fresh troops. The sentries from the
quarter guards watched the communications to the front,
and to the detached posts between the camp and the outlying
piquets, to communicate alarm if announced in any
manner from the front.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tents and Huts</div>

<p>“If the troops were to encamp, the tent mules, which
always immediately followed the column, under charge of
an officer, preceding all other baggage, were unloaded, and
the company’s tents pitched in column on the alignment
given to the battalion, brigade, and division.</p>

<p>“If there were no tents, then the bill-hooks came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
speedily into play: regular squads were formed for cutting
branches, others for drawing them to the lines, and others
as the architects for constructing the huts: this was an
amusement more than a duty, and it was quite wonderful
to see how speedily every one was under cover. It was the
pride of each company that their officers’ huts should be
the first and the best built. The soldier became quite
re-invigorated by the mere act of piling arms, getting off
his accoutrements, pack, haversack, and other incumbrances,
which weigh generally about sixty pounds, and set
to work in right earnest at the hut-building. Although the
huts were not quite so speedily erected, or pitched with the
same regularity, as the tents, yet still the order and alignment
were preserved when the ground permitted. This
might not have been essential, yet still no opportunity
should be allowed to escape in inculcating the habit of
order and regularity in whatever is done by the soldier;
and, however simple the act, it should be impressed on his
mind, that what is ordered is the easiest, and that what is
his duty is his interest.</p>

<p>“The regular fatigue parties for bread, meat, and spirits
were regularly told off and warned, before the companies
were dismissed to pitch tents or build huts. These parties
consisted generally of two or three men per company, under
a corporal, for each particular article of provisions, to be
ready to turn out when that article was called at the
quarter guard. A company’s guard or watch, of a corporal
and four privates, furnishing one sentry with side arms only,
always remained in the lines of the company to repeat
communications and preserve order.</p>

<p>“The Commanding Officers made their reports through
the Majors of brigade, that their respective battalions had
received bread, meat, spirits, and forage, specifying the
number of days for each; that they had marched off one
or more companies, of such and such strength, for the outlying
piquets, to the posts directed under the orders of the
Field Officer of the outlying piquets; and that the orderlies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
who had accompanied them had returned, knowing where
to find them. The outlying piquets were under the Field
Officer of the day, who again received his instructions from
the Assistant Adjutant General of the division. The
Commanding Officers at the same time reported the force
of the company or inlying piquet, which were ready to turn
out to support the outlying piquet in the event of being
required, and were under the Field Officer of the day of the
inlying piquets, and kept on their accoutrements, although
in other respects, like the remaining companies, not on duty,
and in their tents or huts. The company on inlying
piquet, as also the Field Officer of the day in charge of the
whole of the companies of the brigade, were always first
for the outlying piquet.</p>

<p>“All particular duties were taken by companies, under
their own officers, and not by the old way of individual
roster of so many men per company; such were the company
for outlying piquet; the company for inlying piquet, which
gave the quarter and rear guards within the lines; the first
company for general fatigue, from which the Quarter
Master’s fatigues were taken for ammunition, equipment,
working parties, and all other fatigues, excepting rations;
all these duties were taken by the roster of companies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On Drawing Rations</div>

<p>“The issue of rations was regulated by the Quarter
Master and Commissariat, agreeably to the instructions of
the General commanding the division or brigade, communicated
in orders to the battalions, and was done regimentally
by individuals from all the companies, and not
by the company on general fatigue. On the issue of any
article, such as bread, meat, wine, or forage, the fatigue
parties from each company, as before described, were
summoned from the quarter guard by the Quarter Master,
who called out the watch in the lines of each company;
those previously warned for each article turned out under
their respective non-commissioned officers, and assembled
under the officer of the inlying piquet named in the orders
at the quarter guard. He then proceeded with the Quarter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
Master or Quarter Master Sergeant to the place of issue;
after the delivery he returned to the quarter guard, reported
to the Captain of the Day, who was the captain of the inlying
piquet, the regularity or irregularity of the particular
issue under his superintendence, and then dismissed the
parties under their several non-commissioned officers to
their respective companies, where the delivery was immediately
made under the orderly Officer of each company.
The same routine took place when in quarters; and,
although the recapitulation may appear tedious, still the
whole was performed with a celerity which leaves more
time to the soldier when in camp than in any other situation.</p>

<p>“At an appointed hour the sick reports were gathered
from the companies, and the men paraded for the inspection
of the Surgeon; he reported to the Staff Surgeon, who, in
his turn, reported to the General commanding the division,
sending his own report to the Inspector General of Hospitals.</p>

<p>“The General commanding the division made his
reports to the Adjutant and Quarter Master Generals for
the information of the Commander of the Forces, according
to the importance of the report and the circumstances of
the moment.</p>

<p>“When before the enemy, the issue of the provisions
and the cooking were attended to with every consideration
to the position of things, so that what was to be done
should be done with speed as well as precaution; for it
would be bad management to throw away the soup before
it was well made, or swallow it boiling hot, in case of
interruption, and still worse to leave it to the enemy. All
this is sufficiently dwelt upon in the Duke’s ‘Circular
Letter,’ and in the admirable orders of General Robert
Craufurd, from whence the greater part of the foregoing
details were learned and proved in the field.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<p>“The new tin camp-kettle, carried alternately by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
men of each squad, was a great improvement upon the old
Flanders iron cauldron, which required a whole tree, or the
half of a church door, to make it boil; and which, being
carried on the camp-kettle mule (afterwards appropriated
to carry the tents), only arrived with the baggage. This
improvement, as the Duke truly observed in his ‘October
Minute,’ left much valuable time disposable for other
purposes. It is to be hoped that in any future wars some
improvement will also take place in the weight and temper
of the old bill-hook, which, in the early part of the
Peninsular War, was immoderately heavy, and had edges
which, on attempting to cut any wood not absolutely green,
bent like lead: many of the men threw these away, but the
more prudent <em>exchanged</em> them for the lighter and better
tempered bill-hook used by the Portuguese in their vineyards,
exchange being no robbery with our fellows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Miseries of Wet Weather</div>

<p>“In the camp or bivouac, in fine weather, all went on
merrily, but there came moments of which the mere
remembrance even now recalls ancient twitches of rheumatism,
which the iron frame of the most hardy could not
always resist. On the night previous to General Craufurd’s
affair on the Coa, on those previous to the battle of Salamanca
and the battle of Waterloo, and on many other less
anxious nights, not hallowed by such recollections, deluges
of rain not only drenched the earth, but unfortunately all
that rested or tried to rest upon it; the draining through
the hut from above by some ill-placed sticks in the roof,
like lightning conductors, conveyed the subtle fluid where
it was the least wanted; while the floods coursing under,
drove away all possibility of sleep: repose was, of course,
out of the question, when even the worms would come out
of the earth, it being far too wet for them. ‘In such a night
as this’ it was weary work to await the lagging dawn with
a craving stomach; and, worse still, to find nothing but a
bellyful of bullets for breakfast. But, on the Pyrenees, in
the more fortunate and healthy days of tents, it was not
unusual, when the mountain blast and torrents of rain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
drew up the pegs of the tents, for them to fall, as nothing
in nature falls, squash on the soldier, who lay enveloped
and floundering in the horrible wet folds of canvas. Then
nothing but the passing joke ‘Boat a-hoy!’ or the roars of
laughter caused by some wag, who made this acme of misery
into mirth, could re-animate to the exertion of scrambling
out of these clammy winding-sheets. These are recollections,
however, which, notwithstanding the sufferings in
the experience of them, and their legacies of rheumatism,
still afford pleasurable feelings to the old soldier, now laid
up by his Christmas fireside.”</p>

<p>To this long and lively description by an anonymous
Peninsular veteran (probably from the Light Division) of
the way in which Wellington’s army moved, we need only
add a few words by way of caution and supplement. The
smoothly-working regularity which it described could not
always be secured in actual practice. There were marches
where the system could not be carried out, by reason of
hurry, unexpected changes of direction, and the vagaries
of the weather. When some sudden movement of the
French forced the Duke to throw his army on a route that
he had not intended to take, the elaborate provision of
officers going before to act as harbingers could not be
carried out. When a division halted, late at night, at some
unforeseen destination, there could be neither the selection
of billets, nor (in the open field) the erection of huts described
above. All had to be done more or less haphazard in the
dark. In hot or stormy weather stragglers were numerous,
and the “ticket” routine broke down altogether. The
description above will do for long orderly movements like
the advance on Madrid in 1812, or the march to Vittoria,
in 1813, but it fails to reproduce the impression of confusion
and misery caused by the perusal of any good narrative
of the Burgos retreat, or of the disorder in the hasty marches
to intercept Soult on the eve of the battles of the Pyrenees.
A quotation from a diarist in the ranks,<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> giving a picture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
of the first-named march may suffice to give the reverse of
the shield.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Retreat from Burgos</div>

<p>“Retreating before the enemy at any time is a grievous
business, but in such weather as that of November, 1812,
it was doubly so. The rain pouring down in torrents
drenched us to the skin, the road, composed of clay soil,
stuck to our shoes so fast that they were torn off our feet.
The nights were dismally dark, the cold winds blew in
heavy gusts, and the roads became gradually worse. After
marching in this state for hours, we halted in a field by the
roadside, piled our arms, and were allowed to dispose of
ourselves as we best could. The moon, wading through
dense masses of clouds, sometimes threw a momentary
gleam on the miserable beings huddled together in every
variety of posture, and trying to rest or to screen themselves
from the cold. Some were lying on the wet ground rolled
in wetter blankets, some placed their knapsack on a stone,
and sat on it, with their blankets wrapped about them,
their heads resting on their knees, their teeth chattering
with cold. Long before daylight we were again ordered to
fall in, and proceeded on our retreat. The rain still continued
to fall, the roads were now knee-deep in mud.
Many men got fatigued and could not follow: the spring
waggons could not hold them all; they dropped behind to
fall into the hands of the French cavalry. By some mismanagement
the commissary stores had been sent on ahead
with the baggage, toward Rodrigo, and we were without
food. The feeling of hunger was very severe: some oxen
that had remained with the division were killed and served
out to us, but our attempts to kindle cooking fires with wet
wood were abortive. Sometimes we just managed to raise
a smoke, and numbers would gather round a fire, which
then would go out, in spite of their efforts.</p>

<p>“A savage sort of desperation took possession of our
minds: those who lived on most friendly terms with each
other in better times now quarrelled with each other, using
the most frightful imprecations on the slightest offence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
A misanthropic spirit took possession of every breast. The
streams from the hills were swollen into rivers, which we
had to wade, and vast numbers fell out, among them even
officers. It was piteous to see the men, who had long
dragged their limbs after them with a determined spirit,
finally fall down in the mud unable to proceed further.
The despairing looks that they gave us, when they saw us
pass on, would have pierced the heart at any other time;
but our feelings were steeled, and we had no power to
assist, even had we felt the inclination.</p>

<p>“At last the rain somewhat abated, but the cold was
excessive: at the nightly halt many men threw themselves
down in the mud, praying for death to relieve them from
their misery. And some prayed not in vain, for next
morning, starting in the dark, we stumbled over several
who had died in the night. Setting my foot inadvertently
on one, I stooped down to feel, and I shall never forget the
sickening thrill that went to my heart, as my hand touched
his cold, clammy face. This day we halted earlier than
usual, and the weather being clearer, got fires lighted; but
there was nothing to eat save acorns from a wood in which
we encamped—we greedily devoured them, though they
were nauseous in the extreme. Next day’s sufferings were
of the same nature—only more aggravated, till at last we
neared Rodrigo in the dark, halted, and heard at last the
well-known summons of ‘Turn out for biscuit,’ ring in
our ears. We had got to food at last. Instead of the
usual orderly division each man seized what he could get,
and began to allay the dreadful gnawing pain which had
tormented us for four days of unexampled cold and fatigue.”</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Baggage Animals</div>

<p>The train of Wellington’s army was very heavy. In
addition to the long droves of mules and ox-waggons which
carried public stores, there was a very large accumulation
of private baggage. The field equipment of officers—especially
of officers of the higher ranks—strikes the modern
student as very heavy, and was much commented on by
French observers at the time. “To look at the mass of
impedimenta and camp-followers trailing behind the
British,” says Foy, “you would think you were beholding
the army of Darius. Only when you have met them in
the field do you realize that you have to do with the soldiers
of Alexander.” The cause of this accumulation was partly
a survival of the lax customs of the eighteenth century, but
it resulted still more from the character of the country
over which Wellington’s host moved. In the interior of
Spain or Portugal absolutely nothing was to be procured.
The simplest small luxuries, tea, sugar, coffee, were ungettable,
save in the largest towns; to renew clothing was
equally impossible. He who required anything must carry
it with him. It was not like campaigning in France,
Belgium, Germany, or Italy. At the commencement of
his term of command Wellington laid down the rule<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> that
no private baggage was to be carried upon carts: “those
who have baggage to carry, must be provided with mules
and horses.” This order is repeated again and again during
later years.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> A regular scale of the amount of horses and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
mules allowed to officers of different rank was shortly
produced. Two subalterns must share one sumpter-beast
between them, a captain was allowed a whole mule or horse,
and so on, in a mounting scale.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> But as early as September
1, 1809, it would seem that a more liberal allowance was
made legal. In a “general order” of that day we get an
elaborate table of rations of forage for all ranks, from the
commander-in-chief downwards. While subalterns are
allowed one ration each, the number rises enormously for
the seniors, a captain commanding a company is set down
for five rations, a major for seven, a lieutenant-colonel in
charge of a battalion for ten, the Adjutant-General for
twenty, etc., etc. This was a far too liberal allowance for
the senior ranks, and led to an accumulation of beasts,
both riding horses and pack-mules, far surpassing what was
reasonable. To enable them to equip themselves for field
service, all officers (whether staff or regimental) when
ordered for the first time to join the army, were allowed
to draw 200 days “bât, baggage, and forage money.” This
presumably would go towards the purchase of their animals.
The forage allowed was 14 lbs. of hay or straw of the
country, and 12 lbs. of oats, or 10 lbs. of barley or Indian
corn. When English hay was procurable (as at Lisbon)
only 10 lbs. of it might be issued instead of the 14 lbs. of
native stuff. On this system the captain would provide
himself with a riding horse, generally a small Portuguese
nag, and have a mule for his baggage. The subaltern
must walk if he kept a mule: but it seems that very soon
the juniors also took to riding. At any rate, lieutenants
and other juniors often appear with a riding horse. Nothing
is more common in a diary than to find, on his first arrival
in Portugal the young officer procuring himself not one but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
two beasts, generally a nag and a mule. Sometimes he
brought out a horse of his own from England.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> More
usually he <span class="locked">bought—</span></p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">in the horse-market at Lisbon, of which one who had been
through the business <span class="locked">writes:—</span></p>

<p>“The only convenient opportunity to make the purchase
was at a sort of fair held every Tuesday in the lower part
of the town. There horses, mules, and asses were bought
and sold, and (as in all markets) the price chiefly depended
on the demand. The Portuguese horse-dealer has all the
avidity of the English jockey to pick your pocket, but is
not so <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au fait</i> at the business. At this Fair you buy or sell
your animal, the bargain is struck, the money paid, and
the contract is indissoluble. English guineas had no attraction:
the dollar or the moidore was the medium; but
since the guinea has been introduced in the payment of
the army (1813) the Portuguese begin to appreciate its
value. It was customary for officers who wanted cash to
give their draft on some house in London; but it was
purchasing money very dearly, giving at the rate of six
and sixpence for a dollar that would only bring five shillings,
so losing eighteen pence on every crown.”<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<p>Good and large Spanish mules cost as much, or almost
as much, as the small horses of the country. Fifty to
ninety dollars was an ordinary price. Thirty to forty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
pounds was considered cheap for an English riding horse.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a>
A Portuguese nag might be bought for fifteen or twenty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Concerning Messes</div>

<p>“In consequence of the difficulty of transporting
baggage,” writes one of the liveliest commentators on daily
life at the front, “a regiment on active service could not
keep up a regular mess, as in England. Each officer was
obliged to manage for himself: they generally divided
themselves into mess-parties by twos and threes. This
greatly incommoded the subaltern: allowed only the
carriage of half an animal [or at the most of one] it was not
possible to admit, for the purpose of having extra eatables,
any addition to his share of baggage. The mere ration
was all that he got, with a camp-kettle for culinary purposes.
Besides we must recollect the difficulty of getting
extra food, and also the want of money. So the bit of beef
and the ration of biscuit was frequent fare for perhaps
two-thirds of the officers—with the allowance of ration-rum
or wine (generally execrable stuff). The prime luxuries
were a drop of brandy and a segar. With respect to articles
of dress, the contents of a small portmanteau being all that
could be taken about, if a subaltern wore out or lost his
regimental jacket, he had to improvise a substitute, <i>e.g.</i> his
great coat. Waistcoats were as fancy directed, black, blue,
or green, silk or velvet.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though the officer, or at least the junior
officer, thought himself much stinted in baggage, the private
mules of the regiment, and in particular those of the senior
officers, made up quite a drove—at least some thirty or
forty. In addition there were the public mules of the corps,
some thirteen in number—one for each company’s camp
kettles, one for entrenching tools, one for the paymaster’s
books, one for the surgeon’s medical paniers. If we add
to these the private riding horses of the senior officers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
such of the juniors as could afford them, there was quite
a cavalcade—enough to block a road or to encumber a
ford. And unfortunately the mules and horses presupposed
drivers and attendants. Wellington set his face against
the withdrawal from the ranks of soldier-servants to act as
muleteers.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> Each officer, of course, had one; but they
were supposed to be available for service, and could only
look to their master’s business in the halts and encampments.
Hence native servants had to be hired—even
the poorest pair of ensigns wanted a Portuguese boy to
look after their single mule. The colonel had probably
three or four followers. Thus to take charge of its baggage,
private and public, each battalion had a following of twenty
or thirty such attendants, a few English, the large majority
Spanish or Portuguese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Camp Followers</div>

<p>It cannot be denied that these fellows had a villainous
reputation, and largely deserved it. Though many decent
peasant lads were picked up in the countryside by the
earlier comers, and made trustworthy and loyal servants,
the majority were not satisfactory. The sort of followers
whom the officers of a newly-landed regiment engaged at
short notice upon the quays of Lisbon, when only two
or three days were given them for selection, were mostly
“undesirables.” If there were a few among them who
were merely “broken men,”—ruined peasants seeking bread
at any hand that would give it,—the majority were the
scum of a great harbour city, ruffians of the lowest sort.
The best of the Portuguese were with the army: the net of
the conscription was making wide sweeps, and few young
men of the decent class escaped the line or the militia.
Personal service under an English officer, who was certainly
an incomprehensible foreigner, and might well be a hard and
unreasonable master, was not so attractive as to draw the
pick of the Portuguese working classes. It did, on the
other hand, appeal to needy rascals who wanted the chance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
of cheating an employer who knew nothing of the country,
its customs, and its prices. There was splendid opportunity
for embezzlement. Moreover, many looked for more
lucrative, if more dangerous gains. The diaries show that
a very considerable proportion of the hastily-hired muleteers
and servants absconded, after a few days, with their master’s
mule and portmanteau, and were never seen again. Those
who did not, were looking after the plunder of the battlefield,
the camp, and the wayside. It was they who robbed
drunken soldiers, ill-guarded commissary stores, or lonely
villages. They slunk out at night to make privy plunder
in the lines of the regiments in which they were not employed.
On the battlefield they were ruthless strippers of
the wounded—English and Portuguese no less than French—as
well as of the dead. Unless report much mistreats
them, they habitually knocked a wounded Frenchman on
the head, if they were out of sight of the red-coats.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> Considering
the atrocities of which the French had been guilty
in Portugal, this might pass for not unnatural retaliation;
but it is certain that the British wounded were also frequently
plundered, and there is more than a suspicion
that they were sometimes murdered. The Spanish camp-followers
passed as being even more blood-thirsty than
the Portuguese. Of course it was not the officers’ private
employés alone who were guilty of these misdemeanours;
the public muleteers of the commissariat staff, and other
hangers-on of the army, had an equally bad reputation.
The most daring theft of the whole war, as has been already
mentioned, was done by two “authorized followers,” who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
burglariously entered the house of the Commissary-General
in 1814, and got off with no less than £2000 in gold. They
were detected, and naturally suffered the extreme punishment
of the law. By their names one would seem to have
been French, the other a Spaniard. There is an awful
story, told in two diaries, of a camp follower who in a
time of starvation sold to British soldiers as pork slices
cut off a French corpse.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> He got away before he could
be caught and shot. But enough of these ghouls!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Soldiers’ Wives</div>

<p>The followers of a British army were by no means
exclusively foreign. One of the worst impediments to the
free movement of the host came from the unhappy practice
that then prevailed of allowing corps on foreign service
to take with them a proportion of soldiers’ wives—four or
six per company. Forty or sixty of these women, mostly
mounted on donkeys, formed the most unmanageable
portion of every regimental train. They were always
straggling or being left behind, because they could not
keep up with the long marches that the army had often
to take. Wayside tragedies of this sort are to be found
recorded in almost every Peninsular memoir—often of the
most harrowing sort. In especial we may mention the
number of these poor women who dropped in the Corunna
retreat, and died in the snow, or fell into the hands of the
French. The interesting little book of a married sergeant
of the 42nd, who took his wife about with him during the
last three years of the war, is full of curious little
shifts and anxieties that they went through.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> The best
description of this curious stratum of the Peninsular
Army that I know is in the autobiography of Bell of
the 34th.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<p>“The multitude of soldiers’ wives stuck to the army like
bricks: averse to all military discipline, they impeded our
progress at times very much, particularly in retreats. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
became the subject of a General Order, for their own special
guidance. They were under no control, and were always
first mounted up and away, blocking up narrow passes
and checking the advance of the army with their donkeys,
after repeated orders to follow in rear of their respective
corps, or their donkeys would be shot. On the retreat
from Burgos I remember Mrs. Biddy Flyn remarking, ‘I
would like to see the man that wud shoot <em>my</em> donkey:
faith, I’ll be too early away for any of ’em to catch me.
Will you come wid me, girls?’ ‘Aye, indeed, every one
of us.’ And away they started at early dawn, cracking
their jokes about divisional orders, Wellington, commanding
officers, and their next bivouac. Alas! the Provost Marshal
was in advance—a man in authority, and a terror to evil
doers: he was waiting a mile or two on, in a narrow turn
of the road, for the ladies, with a party all loaded. He gave
orders to shoot the first two donkeys <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pour exemple</i>. There
was a wild, fierce and furious yell struck up, with more
weeping and lamentation than one usually hears at an
Irish funeral, with sundry prayers for the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vagabone</i> that had
murdered the lives of the poor darling innocent <em>crathers</em>.
‘Bad luck to the ugly face of the Provost, the spy of the
camp, may he niver see home till the vultures have picked
his eyes out, the born varmint,’ and so on. The victims
picked up what they could carry, and marched along with
the regiment, crying and lamenting their bitter fate. It
was wonderful what they endured—but in spite of this
warning they were foremost on the line of march next
morning again. As Mrs. Skiddy, their leader, said, ‘We
must risk something to be in before the men, to have the
fire and a <em>dhrop</em> of tay ready for them after their load and
their labour: and sure if we went in the <em>rare</em> the French,
bad luck to them, would pick me up, me and my
donkey, and then Dan Skiddy would be lost entirely
without me.’”</p>

<p>The soldiers’ wives were indeed an extraordinary community—as
hard as nails, expert plunderers, furious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
partisans of the supreme excellence of their own battalion,
much given to fighting. Many of them were widows twice
and even thrice over—for when a married man was shot,
and his wife was a capable and desirable person, she would
receive half a dozen proposals before her husband was
forty-eight hours in his grave. And since the alternative
was a hazardous voyage back to relatives in England or
Ireland, who had probably broken off with the “girl who ran
away with a soldier,” most of the widows concluded to stop
with the battalion, with a new spouse and a new name.
As the war dragged on many of the men picked up Portuguese
and Spanish helpmates, who joined the regimental
drove, and made it strangely polyglot. At the end of the
struggle in 1814 there was a most harrowing scene at
Bordeaux, when the general order was issued that all these
foreigners who could not prove that they had been legitimately
married to soldiers, with the colonel’s leave, were
to be refused transport to the British Isles.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> There were
hundreds of them, and only in a few cases could the men
find money to get them taken home in private merchantmen.
The bulk marched back to the Peninsula in charge of a
brigade of homeward bound Portuguese—a most melancholy
and distressful assembly.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ladies at the Front</div>

<p>It is extraordinary to find that a sprinkling of the officers
of the Peninsular Army were unwise enough to take their
wives with them to the front—thereby securing a life of
wearing anxiety for both, and of dire hardship for the poor
ladies. One of the best known cases was that of Hill’s
senior aide-de-camp, Captain Currie, whose wife I have
found mentioned half a dozen times as making tea for the
second division staff, and holding a little reception whenever
the division was settled down for a few days. Another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
was Mrs. Dalbiac, wife of the colonel of the 4th Dragoons,
whose adventures on the field of Salamanca are mentioned
by Napier.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> But the best chronicle of the ups and downs
of a young married couple may be found in the breezy
autobiography of Sir Harry Smith, then a subaltern in the
95th Rifles. His tale is well known—he rescued a young
Spanish lady among the horrors of the sack of Badajoz,
married her two days later, and had her with him for the
remaining three years of the war. The story of their
Odyssey, as related by him, is one of the most touching
narratives of loyal love, and hardship cheerfully borne,
that any man can read. They lived together for forty
years in storm and sunshine, and she survived to christen
the town of Ladysmith by her name, while her husband
was commanding the forces in South Africa. He gave
his name to the sister town of Harrismith, less well remembered
now than the long-besieged place with which the
memory of Juana Smith is linked.</p>

<p>There is a sketch in Paris by the well-known artist,
Colonel Lejeune, who, when a prisoner at Elvas, made a
drawing of an English military family which passed him.
As he describes it in his diary, “The captain rode first on
a very fine horse, warding off the sun with a parasol: then
came his wife very prettily dressed, with a small straw hat,
riding on a mule and carrying not only a parasol, but a little
black and tan dog on her knee, while she led by a cord a
she-goat, to supply her with milk. Beside madame walked
her Irish nurse, carrying in a green silk wrapper a baby,
the hope of the family. A grenadier, the captain’s servant,
came behind and occasionally poked up the long-eared
steed of his mistress with a staff. Last in the procession
came a donkey loaded with much miscellaneous baggage,
which included a tea-kettle and a cage of canaries; it was
guarded by an English servant in livery, mounted on a
sturdy cob and carrying a long posting-whip, with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
he occasionally made the donkey mend its pace.”<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> If this
picture is not exaggerated, it certainly helps us to understand
the strong objection which Wellington had for ladies
at the front, and all forms of impedimenta.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII" class="vspace">CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span class="subhead">A NOTE ON SIEGES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Every one knows that the record of the Peninsular Army
in the matter of sieges is not the most brilliant page in its
annals. It is not to the orgies that followed the storm of
Badajoz or San Sebastian that allusion is here made, but
to the operations that preceded them, and to the unhappy
incidents that accompanied the luckless siege of Burgos.
Courage enough and to spare was lavished on those bloody
leaguers; perseverance was shown in no small measure;
and to a certain extent professional skill was not lacking.
But the tale compares miserably with the great story of the
triumphs of Wellington’s army in the open field. Reckless
bravery had to supply the place of the machinery and
organization that was lacking, and too much blood was
spilt, and sometimes spilt to no effect.</p>

<p>The responsibility for these facts is hard to distribute.
As is generally the case when failures are made, it is clear
that a system was to blame rather than any individual, or
body of individuals. Great Britain had been at war with
France for some sixteen years; but in all her countless
expeditions she had never, since 1794, been compelled to
undertake regular sieges on a large scale. The battering
of old-fashioned native forts in India, the blockades of
Malta or Alexandria, the bombardments of Flushing or
Copenhagen, need hardly be mentioned. They were not
operations such as those which Wellington had to carry
out in 1811 or 1812. For a long time the Peninsular War
had been considered as a purely defensive affair; it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
concerned with the protection of Portugal, almost (we
might say) of Lisbon, from the French invader. The
home Government kept sending reinforcements to Wellington,
but they were under the impression that an over-powerful
combination of the enemy’s forces might some day
force him to re-embark. He himself regarded such a
contingency as by no means impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington’s Battering Train</div>

<p>But in the spring of the year 1811 it became clear that a
defensive war may have offensive episodes. After Masséna’s
retreat from before the Lines of Torres Vedras, Wellington
had to protect the frontiers of Portugal; and to guard
them efficiently he needed possession of Almeida, Ciudad
Rodrigo, and Badajoz, which had all been in the hands of
the allies in the summer of 1810, but were now French
fortresses. To subdue these three places he required a
large battering-train, properly equipped for movement,
and such a thing was not at his disposition. There were a
number of heavy guns mounted on the Lines of Torres
Vedras, and on the ramparts of Elvas, Abrantes, and Peniche.
There were also many companies of Portuguese gunners
attached to those guns, and a lesser number of British companies
which had been immobilized in the Lisbon lines.
But heavy guns and gunners combined do not complete a
battering train. An immense amount of transport was
required, and in the spring of 1811 it was not at Wellington’s
disposition. Well-nigh every available ox-cart and
mule in Portugal was already employed in carrying the
provisions and baggage of the field army. And water
transport, which would have been very valuable, could
only be used for a few miles of the lower courses of the
Tagus and Douro. To begin a regular siege of Almeida in
April, 1811, was absolutely impossible, not because there
were not guns or gunners in Portugal, but because there
were no means of moving them at the time. Wellington
did not even attempt it, contenting himself with a mere
blockade. On the other flank an endeavour was made
to besiege Badajoz, but this was only possible because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
within a few miles of that city lay the Portuguese fortress
of Elvas, from whose walls was borrowed the hastily
improvised and imperfect battering-train with which the
Spanish stronghold was attacked.</p>

<p>The first two sieges of Badajoz in 1811 were lamentable
failures, precisely because this haphazard battering-train
was wholly inadequate for the end to which it was applied.
Alexander Dickson, the zealous and capable officer placed
in charge of the artillery, was set an impossible task. He
had about 400 Portuguese and 120 English gunners, all
equally untrained in siege duty, to work a strange collection
of antiquated and unserviceable cannon. The pieces
borrowed from Elvas were of irregular calibre and ancient
pattern. Almost incredible as it may appear, some of these
long brass 24-pounders were nearly two hundred years
old—observers noted on them the arms and cyphers not
only of John IV. the first king of the Braganza dynasty,
but of Philip III. and Philip IV. of Spain, the contemporaries
of our James I. and Charles I.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> Even the better guns were
of obsolete eighteenth-century types. No two had the
same bore, nor were the shot supplied for them uniform in
size; it was necessary to cull and select a special heap of
balls for each particular gun. The whole formed, indeed,
a sort of artillery museum rather than an effective battering-train.
The guns shot wildly and weakly, and their gunners
were inexperienced. No wonder that their effect was poor.</p>

<p>But this was not all: indeed, the inefficiency of the
guns was perhaps the secondary rather than the primary
cause of the failure of the two early sieges of Badajoz.
More important still was it that Wellington was as weak
in the engineer as in the artillery arm. The number of
trained officers of engineers with the Peninsular Army was
very small—not much over thirty; but of rank and file
to serve under them there were practically none. Of the
corps called the “Royal Military Artificers,” the ancestors
of the “Royal Sappers and Miners,” there were actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
only thirty-four attached to the army in 1810, and it was
far on in 1811 before their numbers reached a hundred.
Many of them were with Wellington’s field army on the
distant frontier of Beira, and before Badajoz, in May, there
were little more than a score. For the trench-work of the
siege untrained volunteers had to be borrowed from the
line battalions, and to be instructed by the engineer officers
actually under the fire of the French guns. Their teachers
were almost all as ignorant of practical siege operations as
themselves; the British Army, as has already been remarked,
had done little work of the sort for many years.</p>

<p>The officers, it is true, were zealous and often clever;
the men were recklessly brave, if unpractised in the simplest
elements of siegecraft. But good-will could not atone for
want of experience, and it seems clear that in these early
sieges the plans were often unwise, and the execution unskilful.
The points of attack selected at Badajoz were the
strongest and least accessible points of the fortress, not
those against which the French had operated in their
earlier siege in February with success. This choice had
been made because the British were working “against
time”; there were French armies collecting for the relief
of Badajoz, and if the leaguer took many weeks, it was
certain that an overwhelming force would be brought
against the besiegers and compel them to depart. Hence
the engineer officers, in both the unsuccessful sieges, tried
to break in at points where victory would be decisive;
they thought it would be useless to begin by capturing
outworks, or by making a lodgment in the lower parts of
the city, which would leave its stronger points intact and
capable of further defence. They battered the high-lying
fort of San Cristobal, and the citadel on its precipitous
height, arguing that if they could capture either of them
the whole fortress was at their mercy. Both the points
assailed turned out to be too strong: the stony hill of
San Cristobal proved impossible for trench work; desperate
attempts to storm the fort that crowned it, by columns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
advancing across the open, were beaten off with heavy loss.
The castle walls, after long battering, refused to crumble
into practicable breaches. Before anything decisive had
been accomplished, the French armies of succour came up.
Beresford beat the first at Albuera in May and renewed the
siege; the second (Soult and Marmont combined) was so
strong that Wellington dared not face it, and withdrew
from his abandoned trenches to within the Portuguese
frontier in July.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Colonel Dickson’s Work</div>

<p>A great change for the better in Wellington’s position
as regards sieges had been made by the autumn of 1811.
He had at last received a number of good modern British
iron guns, much superior to the old Portuguese brass 24-pounders.
And with infinite trouble and delay he had
at last created a battering-train that could move. This
was the work of Alexander Dickson, already mentioned,
who was occupied from July to November in accumulating
at the obscure town of Villa da Ponte, behind Almeida,
masses of waggon-transport and trains of mules and oxen,
for the moving of the heavy cannon and the immense store
of ammunition belonging to them. The guns were brought
up the Douro to Lamego, where the river ceased to be
navigable, and then dragged over the hills by oxen. Several
companies of Portuguese and British gunners were attached
to the park, and instructed, so far as was possible, in
siege work. At the same time the military artificers—still
far too few in numbers—were instructing volunteers
from the line in the making of a great store of gabions, platforms,
fascines, and other necessaries.</p>

<p>This long preparation, which was almost unsuspected
by the French, because it was unostentatious and made at
a great distance from the front, enabled Wellington to
execute the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo in January, 1812,
with unexampled rapidity and success. The fortress was
not one of the first class, the garrison was rather weak, the
battering-train was now ample for the task required of
it, and, to the surprise and dismay of Marmont, Rodrigo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
fell after a siege of only twelve days at midwinter (January
7–19) long before he could collect his scattered divisions
for its relief.</p>

<p>The third attack on Badajoz, in March-April, 1812,
turned out a much less satisfactory business, though it
ended in a triumphant success. Like the two sieges of
the preceding year, it was conducted “against time”;
Wellington being fully aware that if it went on too long the
relieving armies would be upon him. The means employed
were more adequate than those of 1811, though only a
part of the battering-train that had subdued Ciudad
Rodrigo could be brought across the hills from the distant
frontier of Beira. The remainder was composed of ship-guns
borrowed from Lisbon. But though the artillery
was not inadequate, and the walls were thoroughly well
breached, both the trench-work and the storm cost over-many
lives. Indeed, the main assault on the breaches
failed, and the town fell because two subsidiary attacks
by escalade, one carried out by Picton, the other by General
Walker with a brigade of the 5th Division, were both
triumphantly successful. Wellington laid the blame of
the fearful loss of life upon the fact that his engineers had
no trained sappers to help them, and were unskilled in
siegecraft. They had attacked a point of the defences far
more promising than those battered in 1811, and had opened
up immense gaps in the defences, but nevertheless he was
not satisfied with their direction. In a private letter to
Lord Liverpool, which is not printed in either of the two
series of his dispatches, he <span class="locked">wrote:—</span></p>

<p>“The capture of Badajoz affords as strong an instance
of the gallantry of our troops as has ever been displayed.
But I anxiously hope that I shall never again be the instrument
of putting them to such a test as that to which they
were put last night. I assure your lordship that it is quite
impossible to carry fortified places by ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vive force</i>’ without
incurring great loss, and being exposed to the chance of
failure, unless the army should be provided with a sufficient
trained corps of sappers and miners.... The consequence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
of being so unprovided with the people necessary to approach
a regularly fortified place are, first, that our engineers,
though well-educated and brave, have never turned their
minds to the mode of conducting a regular siege, as it is
useless to think of that which it is impossible, in our service,
to perform. They think they have done their duty when
they have constructed a battery with a secure communication
to it, which can breach the place. Secondly, these
breaches have to be carried by <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vive force</i>, at an infinite
sacrifice of officers and soldiers.... These great losses
could be avoided, and, in my opinion, time gained in every
siege, if we had properly trained people to carry it on.
I declare that I have never seen breaches more practicable
in themselves than the three in the walls of Badajoz, and
the fortress must have surrendered with these breaches
open, if I had been able to ‘approach’ the place. But
when I had made the third breach on the evening of the 6th,
I could do no more. I was then obliged either to storm or
to give the business up, and when I ordered the assault, I
was certain that I should lose our best officers and men.
It is a cruel situation for any person to be placed in, and I
earnestly recommend to your lordship to have a corps of
sappers and miners formed without loss of time.”<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington and His Engineers</div>

<p>The slaughter of Badajoz, then, in Wellington’s estimation,
was due partly to the fact that the British Army,
unlike all other armies, lacked regular companies of sappers
and miners, and partly to the inexperience of the engineer
officers in carrying out the last stages of a siege—the
advance towards the glacis and the ditch by scientific
trench-work. They did not, he says, “turn their mind”
towards such operations, because they had never been
furnished with skilled workmen to carry them out. That
sappers and miners did not exist as yet was not the fault
of Wellington, nor of the ministers, but of the professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
advisers of the administration, who should long ago have
pointed out that such a corps was wanted. That the
Liverpool ministry was not slow to take advice was shown
by the fact that they at once converted the already existing
“Military Artificers” into sappers. On April 23, less than
three weeks after Badajoz fell, a warrant was issued for
instructing the corps in military field works, and shortly
after six companies were ordered to be sent to the Peninsula
the moment that they should have received such training.
On August 4 the name of the whole corps was changed
from Royal Military Artificers to Royal Sappers and Miners.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a>
It was not, of course, till very late in the year that the first
of the new sapper companies joined Wellington, but by
the next spring he had 300 trained men with him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile they had of course arrived too late for the
siege of Burgos, the most unhappy of all Wellington’s
leaguers, where the whole trench-work was conducted by
volunteers from the line directed by precisely eight of the
old artificers—of whom one was killed and the remaining
seven wounded. The story of the Burgos operations reads
like an exaggerated repetition of the first siege of Badajoz.
The battering-train that took Badajoz had been left behind,
and to attack Burgos (whose strength was undervalued)
Wellington had with him no proper means. Only eight guns
were brought up—because the transport with the army
could only provide a few spare teams, and the whole of
Castile had been swept clear of draught-beasts. This
ridiculously weak train proved wholly insufficient for the
work set it. “Had there been a siege establishment with
the army even moderately efficient, so as to have admitted
of the performance of the rudiments of the art, the attack
(even with the inadequate artillery) might have been carried
through,” writes the historian of the Peninsular sieges.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a>
But there were only five engineer officers present, just
eight artificers, no tools save regimental picks and shovels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
borrowed from line regiments, no <em>material</em> save wood
requisitioned from the town of Burgos, and so little transport
that the fire had sometimes to cease, to allow fresh ammunition
to be brought up from the distant Madrid. Wellington
ordered repeated assaults on the inadequately battered
walls; they all failed, and he finally retired after thirty-two
days of open trenches, and with the loss of nearly 2000 men,
from before a “bicocque,” as the French called it, which
could not have withstood a proper battering-train for a
third of that time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Failure at Burgos</div>

<p>The fact is that Wellington had undervalued the strength
of Burgos; he thought it would fall easily. If he had
known that it would hold out for more than a month, he
could have procured more guns from the captured French
arsenal at Madrid, and might have requisitioned all the
beasts of the army to draw them. But by the time that
it began to be seen that Burgos was not about to yield to
a mere demonstration, it was too late to get up the necessary
means of reducing it. Finally, the French armies mustered
for its relief, and the British had to retire. It may be
added that the besieging troops, thoroughly disgusted with
the inadequate means used to prepare the way for them,
did not act with the same energy that had been shown at
Rodrigo or Badajoz. Several of the assaults were not
pushed well home, and the trench-work was slack. Wellington
wrote, in his General Orders for October 3, a stiff
rebuke, to the effect that “the officers and soldiers of this
army should know that to work during a siege is as much a
part of their duty as to engage the enemy in the field;
and they may depend upon it that unless they perform
the work allotted to them with due diligence, they cannot
acquire the honour which their comrades have won in
former sieges.... The Commander-in-Chief hopes he
shall have no reason to complain in future.”<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></p>

<p>The leaguer of San Sebastian, the last of Wellington’s
sieges, bore a great likeness to the last siege<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
of Badajoz. It was conducted in a time of considerable
anxiety, while the army of Soult was making vigorous and
repeated efforts to frustrate it. The place was strong by
nature—a towering castle with the town at its foot joined
to the mainland only by a narrow sandy spit; the defences
of this isthmus were short, and reached from sea to sea:
they were fully commanded by the castle behind. The
first great assault (July 25, 1813) was made while the
trenches were still far from the walls, and while the fire of
the besieged had not been silenced. It failed with heavy
loss. The second assault (August 31) was successful, but
very bloody—2000 men were killed or wounded. The most
authoritative commentator writes: “The operations against
San Sebastian afford a most impressive lesson on the
advantages of proceeding step by step, and with due attention
to science and rule. The attempt there made to
overcome or trample on such restrictions caused a certain
operation of twenty days to extend to sixty. It bears
strong testimony to the truth of the maxim laid down by
Marshal Vauban: ‘La précipitation dans les sièges ne
hâte point la prise des places, la retarde souvent, et ensanglante
toujours la scène.’”<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Trench Work</div>

<p>There can be no doubt that siege-work was loathed by
the rank and file, not so much for its danger—there was never
any lack of volunteers for a forlorn hope—but for its discomfort.
There was a sort of underlying feeling that entrenching
was not soldier’s but navvy’s work; the long
hiding under cover in cramped positions, which was absolutely
necessary, was looked upon as a sort of skulking.
With an unwise disregard for their personal safety, which
had a touch of bravado and more than a touch of sulkiness
in it, the men exposed themselves far more than was
necessary. I fancy that on some occasions, notably at
the early sieges of Badajoz and at Burgos, there was a general
feeling that matters were not being scientifically or adequately
conducted, and that too much was being asked of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
the rank and file, when they were made to attempt a hard
task without the proper means. It must have been clear to
them that there were too few engineer officers, not enough
artillery, and no proper provision of tools. Hence came
a spirit of anger and discontent.</p>

<p>At Ciudad Rodrigo, and at the third and last leaguer
of Badajoz, the weather was so abominable that the siege-work
was long looked back on as a perfect nightmare.
At Rodrigo, in the high upland of Leon, the month of January
was a combination of frost and rain; the water accumulated
in the trenches and there often froze, so that the men
were standing ankle-deep in a mixture of ice and mud,
and since they could not move about, because of the
enemy’s incessant fire, suffered horribly from cold. At
Badajoz there was no frost: but incessant chilling rain was
almost as bad during the early weeks of the siege; the
trenches were often two feet deep in water, and the work
of the spade was almost useless, since the liquid mud that
was shovelled up ran away in streams out of the gabions
into which it was cast, and refused to pile up into parapets
for the trenches, spreading out instead into mere broad
accumulations of slime, which gave no cover, and had no
resisting power against the round shot of the garrison.
I imagine that the desperate and dirty toil in those operations,
protracted over many days of abominable discomfort
as well as danger, accounts in great measure for the ferocious
spirit shown by the victors both at Rodrigo and Badajoz.
The men were in a blind rage at the misery which they had
been enduring, and it found vent, after the storm was
over, in misconduct far surpassing that which would have
followed a pitched battle where the losses had been equally
great. One observer writes: “The spirit of the soldiers
rose to a frightful height—I say frightful because it was
not of that sort which denoted exultation at the prospect
of achieving an exploit which was about to hold them up
to the admiration of the world; there was a certain <em>something</em>
in their bearing which told plainly that they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
suffered fatigues of which they had not complained, and
seen their comrades and officers slain around them without
repining, but that they had smarted under the one and
felt acutely for the other. They smothered both, so long
as body and mind were employed, but now, before the
storm, they had a momentary licence to think, and every
fine feeling vanished—plunder and revenge took their
place.... A quiet but desperate calm replaced their
usual buoyant spirits, and nothing was observable in their
manner but a tiger-like expression of anxiety to seize upon
their prey.”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Waiting for the Storm</div>

<p>Preparation for the storm affected different men in
different ways: some tried to make up old quarrels and
exchanged words of forgiveness; a good many wrote
letters home, which were to be delivered only in the case
of their falling. “Each arranged himself for the combat in
such manner as his fancy would admit of: some by lowering
their cartridge-boxes, others by turning them to the front
for more convenient use; others unclasped their stocks
or opened their shirt collars; others oiled their bayonets.
Those who had them took leave of their wives and children—an
affecting sight, but not so much so as might have
been expected, because the women, from long habit, were
accustomed to such scenes of danger.”<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></p>

<p>One intelligent sergeant speaks of the moment of waiting
for the order to storm as full of a stress that nothing else
could produce: “We felt a dead weight hanging on our
minds; had we been brought hurriedly into action, it would
have been quite different, but it is inconsistent with the
nature of man not to feel as I have described. The long
warning, the dark and silent night, the known strength
of the fortress, the imminent danger of the attack, all
conspired to produce this feeling. It was not the result of
want of courage, as was shown by the calm intrepidity of
the advance when we came in range of the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
cannon.”<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> That the revulsion from the long waiting took
the shape of frenzied violence, when the men were at last
let loose, was not unnatural. A certain amount of the horrors
which took place at Badajoz and San Sebastian may be
ascribed to mere frenzy, if the rest was due to more
deliberate wickedness on the part of the baser spirits of the
army.</p>

</div>

<p>Without going into the niceties of regimental detail, which
were fully developed by 1809, it is necessary to give a certain
attention to the dress of the army—we might almost add,
to its occasional want of dress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Concerning Head-Gear</div>

<p>The Peninsular Army was fortunate in having started
just late enough to be rid of the worst of the unpractical
clothing—the legacy of the eighteenth century—which had
afflicted the troops of the earlier years of the war. The odd
hat, shaped something like a civilian beaver, with a shaving-brush
at the side, which had been worn in Holland and
Egypt, had just been superseded for the rank and file by
a light felt shako, with brass plate in front,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> and a woollen
tuft with the regimental colours (worn sometimes in front,
sometimes at the side), and ornamented with white loops
and tassels.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> This was a light head-dress, compared with
what had gone before, and no less with the heavy, bell-topped
leather shakos that were to come after. Wellington
protested against an early attempt to introduce these,
saying that he always knew his own troops at a distance,
even when great-coated, by the fact that their shakos were
narrower at the crown than the base, while the French
headgear was always bell-topped, swelling out from the
bottom to the crown, and the distinction was useful. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
felt shako had a peak to protect the eyes from the sun, and
a chin-strap. It was a serviceable head-dress, whose only
fault was that, after long wear, and exposure to much rain,
the felt became soft and might crease or bulge, and then
dry into unsightly and lop-sided shapes.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></p>

<p>Down to 1811, officers of the line, except in rifle and
light infantry corps, were wearing cocked hats, as had been
the custom since the eighteenth century. The new clothing
which came out in 1812 had shakos (of a more ornamental
sort) for officers as well as men. The very sensible reason for
the change was that obvious difference in dress between
commissioned and non-commissioned ranks enabled the
enemy’s marksmen to single out the officers, and to give
them more than their fair share of bullets. The discarded
cocked hat had been a stupid survival—a “burlesque of a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chapeau</i> usually topped by some extraordinary-looking
feather,” says one wearer of it, while others wore it without
any feather at all. The “cut-down” hat, exactly a span in
height, was all the rage in the Lines of Torres Vedras during
the winter of 1810–11.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> The felt shako was an enormous
improvement in every way. After 1811, only generals and
staff officers, engineers, doctors, commissaries, and drum-majors
retained the cocked hat. The last case that I
remember of its being used in the line was that of Lieutenant
Maguire, of the 4th, who, leading the “forlorn hope” at the
storm of San Sebastian (Aug., 1813) put on a cocked hat
with a white feather “to make himself conspicuous and
recognizable.” Clearly this head-dress was by that date
wholly abnormal.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></p>

<p>Another evil which the Peninsular Army escaped also
belonged to the head. Pigtails and hair-powder went out
in 1808—an immense boon. As one who had endured them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
says, “The hair required to be soaped, floured, and frizzed,
in order to be tortured into an uncouth shape, which gave
the man acute pain, and robbed him of the power of turning
his head easily, unless he brought his body round with it.”
The grease and flour matted the hair, and inclined towards
all sorts of scalp diseases. Wellington, who had discarded
hair-powder and dressing long before most officers,<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> must
have been rejoiced when it became legally permissible to
do without it in all ranks. It was not every one who agreed
with him—a few old-fashioned men still wore pigtails and
powder for some time in the Peninsula; but they soon
died out.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1808, that these monstrosities vanished
another affliction was relieved. Trousers of a blue-grey
colour were substituted for breeches and gaiters, as service
dress, just before the first brigades sailed, in 1808. The
many-buttoned gaiters to the knee had been an intolerable
nuisance; there was every temptation not to strip them
off at all, when it took twelve minutes to button them up
efficiently, more if they were wet through. Hence troops
liable to be alarmed at any moment were tempted not to
take them off at all for many days, which led to uncleanliness
and diseases in the legs. Trousers were a great improvement—they
were less tight, and could be easily slipped
into and out of. Under the trousers short boots (often
called shoes) were worn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Regimental Coat</div>

<p>The coat for all ranks in the infantry was cut short in
front, and had fairly small tails; it still preserved, more or
less, the late eighteenth century cut in this respect, but
differed from the earlier type in having the stiff upstanding
collar supported by a leather stock, an evil device which
constricted the neck and tended to apoplexy. On hard
service, such as storming parties, the men unbuttoned their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
collars and threw their stocks aside.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> The most characteristic
point that strikes the eye in pictures of the rank and
file of the Peninsular period is the series of white stripes
across the front of the coat, caused by the ornamental
prolongation of the button guards. Bayonet and cartouche
box were supported by the broad white leather cross-belts,
ornamented with a brass plate with the regimental badge.
The very heavy knapsack, normally of oilskin or glazed
canvas, was supported by a separate attachment of straps
passing under the arm-pits. The whole kit weighed some
sixty pounds, when the canteen and haversack are taken
into consideration. Officers had only a single leather belt
coming from the right shoulder to the left hip, to sustain the
sword, and wore their red silk sashes girt tight, in several
turns around their waists.</p>

<p>One of Wellington’s most sensible traits was an intense
dislike of worrying officers or men about details of uniform
on active service. “Provided we brought our men into the
field well appointed,” says Grattan of the 88th, “with their
sixty rounds of ammunition each, he never looked to see
whether trousers were black, blue, or grey: and as to
ourselves, we might be rigged out in any colour of the rainbow
if we fancied it.” The consequence was that scarcely
any two officers were dressed alike! Some wore grey
braided coats, others brown: some again liked blue; many
(from choice, or perhaps necessity) stuck to the “old red
rag.” Some wore long-skirted frock-coats, as better
protection to the loins than the orthodox regimental cut.
There are some curious records of the odd clothing in which
officers finished a campaign. One records that he did the
Burgos retreat in a garment improvised from the cassock
of a priest, slit up and cut short and furnished with buttons.
Another, a captain in the 29th, landing in Great Britain in
a braided pelisse and a fancy waistcoat with silver buttons
of Spanish filigree work, was taken for some sort of French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
prisoner by a worthy general, who congratulated him on
being allowed such freedom in the place of his captivity.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a>
As to the men, they wore anything that could be got: a
quantity of French trousers found at the capture of Madrid,
in the Retiro fort, were issued to some corps. A more rough
expedient was that of a colonel with a very ragged regiment
in the winter of 1813–14, who allowed blankets to be cut
up by the regimental tailors, to make up into trousers for
such of the men as were absolutely disreputable in appearance.
The battalion made some sensation when it marched
into Mont-de-Marsan a few days later.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></p>

<p>All this did not vex Wellington’s soul in the least—from
Picton’s tall beaver hat to the blanket-trousers, he saw and
disregarded every detail. He himself was the most simply
dressed man in the army, with his small cocked hat unornamented
save by the English and Portuguese cockades, his
blue, tight-buttoned frock-coat, and the short cloak with
cape which has been immortalized by a score of statues and
pictures.</p>

<p>I ought, perhaps, to mention that the winter-clothing
for the infantry was a grey pepper-and-salt coloured great
coat, of very thick cloth, with a cape reaching down to
nearly the elbow, so as to give a double thickness of protection
to the shoulders. There was also an oilskin cover
to the felt shako, which could not always be easily adjusted
to the latter, when it had got distorted in shape from much
wear. Plate No. 8 gives an illustration of this costume.</p>

<p>When the Peninsular Army first started on its campaigns,
the heavy dragoons were the most archaic-looking corps in
it, for they still wore the broad and heavy cocked hats,
which had prevailed in all armies during the middle years
of George III., and jack boots up to the knee. This headgear,
which after a single campaign in the tropical rains of
the Peninsula always became sodden and shapeless, and
hung down limply towards the shoulders, was fortunately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
abolished by a royal warrant of August, 1812, and during
the following winter many of the heavy dragoon regiments
received brass helmets of a classical shape, with a crest and
plume, which, though rather heavy, were an immense
improvement on their former shapeless hats. At the same
time they were given instead of jack-boots (which had made
skirmishing on foot almost impossible) grey cloth overalls,
with a broad red stripe, and short boots. This was the
dress of the heavies in 1813–14 and during the Waterloo
campaign.</p>

<p>The light dragoons had gone to the Peninsula in 1808
with the black japanned helmet with a bearskin crest
along its crown, which had been in use since the time
of the American War. With it they wore blue coats
with white froggings, and buckskin breeches with Hessian
boots. The general effect was handsome, and in use the
dress was not unpractical. General Foy mentions it with
approval in his history. The French outposts were much
puzzled when, at the commencement of the Vittoria campaign,
the English vedettes and outposts appeared in a new
uniform, which was introduced for light cavalry at the same
time as the changes made for heavy cavalry just mentioned
above. It was at first suspected that new regiments had
been joining from England. The 1813 uniform substituted,
for the black helmet with fur, a shako with a small upright
plume, slightly bell-topped in shape, and with ornamental
cord and tassels. It looks as if it had been suggested by the
head-dress of the French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chasseurs à cheval</i>, and was much
too like it to please Wellington. At the same time the blue
jacket barred with white lace was changed for a blue coat,
with a very broad plastron of the colour of the regimental
facings in front, extending from collar to waist, and the
buckskin breeches were replaced by tight-fitting breeches
of webbing. This was the Waterloo uniform of all light
dragoon regiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cavalry Uniforms</div>

<p>The large majority of the British cavalry regiments in
the Peninsula were light dragoons: for the first three years of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
Wellington’s command there were only three heavy dragoon
regiments in the field, and no British hussars. Of the latter,
a new introduction in the national Army, there was one
brigade present in 1808 during Sir John Moore’s operations,<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a>
and the same regiments came out in 1813, to see the last
year of the war.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> During the greater part of Wellington’s
campaigns the only hussars present with the army were
Hanoverians, the very efficient corps belonging to the King’s
German Legion. The fantastic hussar uniform of the
period, a development from a much simpler Hungarian
original, is well known. Over a jacket fitting tight to the
body, was worn the furred and braided pelisse, which was
usually not completely put on, but flung back, so as to hang
over the left shoulder. It flapped behind, and was a
hindrance rather than a covering. On the legs long overalls
were worn. The head-dress was a very large fur cap, or, as
it would have been called later, a busby. I find very severe
criticisms on this head-gear. One officer says, “These
flimsy, muff-like appendages encumber the heads of our
soldiers. The awkward cap, being constructed partly of
pasteboard, soaks up a great quantity of wet during the
violent rains of this country, and so becomes unbearably
heavy and disagreeable, while it affords no protection to
the wearer. At all times it can be cut down to his skull
with the greatest ease.”<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> The cause of its adoption seems
to have been rather the Prince Regent’s eye for splendour
in military costume than anything else. For strength and
protection, no less than comfort, the light helmet of the
early dragoons was universally preferred by critics. Later
improvements made the busby more solid and less heavy,
but in 1808 it was evidently a most unsatisfactory head-dress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Artillery Uniforms</div>

<p>Artillery uniform may be described in a few words.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
That of the horse artillery was a close copy of that of the
original light dragoon—black japanned helmet with fur
crest, blue jacket laced with gold (instead of the dragoon’s
silver) and buckskin breeches. Field artillery, on the other
hand, were clothed almost exactly like infantry of the line,
save that their coats were blue instead of red. Their tall
felt shako and tuft, trousers, and coat with white stripes,
were exactly similar to those of the linesmen. Engineer
officers wore a dress like that of line officers before the
shako came in, having a cocked hat down to the end of the
war, and trousers. The rank and file of that department—Royal
Military Artificers down to 1812,<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> Royal Sappers and
Miners after—had shako and blue coat down to 1813, but
changed the latter for a red coat, like that of the line, in the
last-named year. It was braided with yellow across the
front instead of white, the only practical difference in
appearance.</p>

<p>Doctors and commissaries down to the end of the war
were wearing a cocked hat, like that of a general or a staff
officer. Hence some queer mistakes, when these peaceful
gentlemen were mistaken for combatant officers, the colour
of their plume, the one differentiating point, failing to be
observed in the dusk or in dirty weather. It is said that
some young commissaries were prone to pass themselves
off as staff officers on the Spanish and Portuguese peasantry,
and even on local authorities. A ridiculous anecdote is
told of Doctor Maurice Quill, the surgeon of the Connaught
Rangers, who was the best-known humorist in the army.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a>
A general, who caught a glimpse of his cocked hat behind a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
hedge, took him for a staff-officer shirking, and hunted him
for some time from cover to cover, the doctor meanwhile
shouting back to him, “I’m off; seen plenty of fighting for
one day.” It was only when he took refuge with his mules
and medical panniers, that his irate pursuer discovered that
he was not a combatant officer. Other wearers of the cocked
hat were the drum-majors of the line, who are said to have
had much adulation paid to them by the country-folk,
because of their enormous gold-laced head-dress and lavish
display of braiding, which caused them to be taken for
brigadiers at the least.</p>

<p>The most distinctive infantry uniform in the whole
army was that of the rifle battalions, whose sombre colours
contrasted in the most marked way with the red of the
British and the bright blue of the Portuguese line.
The dress of the 5/60th and the two light battalions of
the K.G.L. differed from that of the three battalions of the
95th, in that while both wore the dark rifle-green jacket,
the three German units had grey-blue trousers not unlike
those of the line, while the latter were in green from head
to foot. All wore black shakos of a high shape, like those
of other regiments, and with a green tuft or ball at the
front. The accoutrements were all black, in order to avoid
the showing of light or shining points on the body, when the
men were dispersed in skirmishing. In the head-dress of
the officers there was a certain variety, the 5/60th and 1st
Light battalion K.G.L. having a tall shako similar to that
of their rank and file, while those of the 95th and the
2nd Light battalion K.G.L. had a peculiar head-dress,
something like that of an eighteenth-century hussar; it was
a tall, narrow cap, much adorned with diagonal twists of
braid, and destitute of the peak to shade the eyes which
formed part of the normal shako; it had a green tuft at
the front. The 95th officers for some time wore over their
tight jackets a black furred and braided pelisse, in the
hussar style—surely a most absurd and inconvenient
encumbrance for men who were continually scrambling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
through hedges, and working among thick brushwood.
When thrown back, as it seems generally to have been, it
must have caught in every possible twig. The officers’
jackets were distinguished from the plain-breasted coat of
the rank and file by having a great quantity of narrow
braiding across the front: they all wore falling “wings,”
instead of epaulettes. The Portuguese caçador uniform,
save that it was brown and not bottle-green, reproduced
very closely the cut and form of that of the 5/60th.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<div class="sidenote">“Brown Bess”</div>

<p>A word as to armament naturally follows on notes concerning
uniform. The weapon that mainly won the
Peninsular victories was the “Tower musket” of the line
battalions, the famous “Brown Bess.” It was a heavy
flint-lock, fitted with a pan, and weighing about nine
pounds. Its effective range was about 300 yards, but no
accurate shooting could be relied upon at any range over
100. Indeed, the man who could hit an individual at that
distance must not only have been a good shot, but have
possessed a firelock of over average quality. Compared
with the rifle, already a weapon of precision, it was but a
haphazard sort of arm. At any distance over the 100
yards the firing-line relied upon the general effect of the
volley that it gave, rather than on the shooting of each man.
Nevertheless, the British musket was decidedly a stronger,
better made and more accurate weapon than that used by
Continental armies, and was much preferred by our Spanish
and Portuguese allies to those of their own manufacture.
Its calibre was sixteen, its missile was a round leaden bullet
(a little heavier than the French ball, whose weight was
twenty to the pound), and made up with a stout paper
cartridge, of which each man normally carried sixty. In
order to secure certain ignition by the snapping of the flint,
the butt-end of the cartridge had to be torn open by the
teeth, before it was placed in the musket barrel, and a splash
of powder had to be thrown into the pan to catch the
spark and communicate it to the cartridge. The latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
was driven down the barrel by an iron ramrod. Raw
recruits in a moment of excitement, firing too fast, are said
not infrequently to have forgotten to withdraw the ramrod
after loading, and to have shot it away—which left them
helpless.</p>

<p>The greatest hindrance to good musketry was wet.
Long-continued rain might penetrate the cartouch box, and
damp all the powder, so that every cartridge missed fire. But
even a sudden heavy squall might drench the particular
cartridge that was being handled, and make its torn-open
end incapable of ignition. Or it might wash the priming-powder
out of the pan, or damp it into a paste, so that it
could not catch fire. In either case, infantry fighting in a
rainstorm could not count on any certain fire-effect; not
one shot in four might go off, and troops surprised in open
order by cavalry would be very helpless. Their only
chance of salvation would be to form square and trust to
the defensive power of the bayonet. The latter weapon
was long, triangular, and rather heavy; its weight did not
make accurate shooting easier, when it was fixed.</p>

<p>There was a somewhat lighter and more carefully made
weapon for light infantry battalions, called the light infantry
musket; except that its sights were more accurately seen
to, and that its length was slightly less, I cannot find that
it greatly differed from the normal Tower musket. The
same may be said of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fusil</i>, which was an older type of
light musket, which had originally given its name to all
fusiliers. The last time that it occurs in use, was when it
was given during the latter years of the war to the experimental
home battalions, into which boys under seventeen
were drafted. To suit their short stature and younger
muscles, fusils instead of full-sized muskets were served out
to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Baker Rifle</div>

<p>Quite different from all muskets were the rifles served
out to the 5/60th, the 95th, and the Light Battalions of the
K.G.L. The pattern was called the Baker rifle, from
its inventor. It was a short weapon with a barrel two and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
half feet long, furnished with seven grooves within, which
made a quarter-turn in the length of the barrel. Its calibre
was a twenty bore, and it was stiff to load. An interesting
letter from one of the majors of the 5/60th to the assistant
adjutant-general at Cork, written just before the battalion
sailed for Portugal, makes a demand for 450 small mallets,
for the purpose of forcing the bullet down the barrel.
“They should be made of hard wood, with a handle about
six inches long, pierced with a hole at the extremity for
fastening a string to it.” Major Davy adds that “the
instrument is absolutely necessary,” and a mallet for every
two men should be furnished.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> These tools, however, were
in use only for a few months, were found not indispensable,
and were finally withdrawn. But to ram the ball home was
always a hard job, owing to the grooves. The rifleman
carried no bayonet, his second weapon being a very short
and curved sword, more useful for wood-chopping than
anything else.</p>

<p>Sergeants were not yet armed like the rank and file,
except in the rifle battalions, where they carried the normal
weapon of the “Baker” type. In the Guards and line
alike they had a seven-foot spear with a cross-piece below
the head, to prevent over-penetration after a thrust.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> The
names of pike and halberd were used for it indifferently,
though the former was the more correct, the original
halberd having been a cut-and-thrust weapon with an
edge as well as a point. In addition, the sergeant carried
a brass-hilted sword at his left side. I have never found
any mention of its being used, the halberd being always the
preferred weapon—though in action a sergeant often picked
up a dead man’s musket, and joined in the firing.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en revanche</i>, I have found a confession by a newly made
sergeant of his having caught it between his legs, and had a
nasty fall, on his first appearance with the three stripes.
The weapon was slightly curved, and meant for cutting
rather than thrusting.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the infantry officer’s sword was quite
straight and rather light, a thrusting weapon essentially.
There are many complaints that it was too slight for its
work—<i>e.g.</i> it had no chance against a French cavalry
sword, which would always batter it down, when the two
clashed in stroke and parry. I have found it called a
“toasting-fork,” and other insulting names. Many officers
provided themselves with foreign weapons of a heavier
make, and better adapted for cutting; no objection was
made to this departure from the regulations. Mounted and
staff officers carried a different sword—a curved broad-bladed
sabre, of the type of that used by light cavalry.
Rifle officers also used a curved sabre, of a rather short
make, and not the straight infantry sword.</p>

<p>Heavy cavalry used the broad-sword with steel hilt and
guard, straight and very heavy. It could be used for the
thrust as well as for the cut, but it would seem that the
British dragoons (unlike the French cuirassiers) always
preferred the edge to the point. The sabre of the light
dragoon and the hussar was a markedly curved weapon,
very broad in the blade, and only suitable for the stroke,
though very occasionally we hear of a thrust being made.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a>
From the enormous proportion of wounded to killed in
engagements where the French and English light cavalry
met, it is clear that the sabres of both sides were better suited
to maim than to slay. The thrusting sword of the cuirassiers
had a much more terrible reputation.</p>

<p>The rank and file of the Royal Sappers and Miners
carried muskets and bayonets like infantry of the line, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
their sergeants the regulation halberd. Horse artillery
gunners had sabres of the light dragoon type; but field
artillery only very short curved swords, like those of the
rifle regiments. The drivers, who were organized as a
separate corps, had no weapons at all, in order that their
attention might not be distracted from their horses. This
seems to have been a very doubtful expedient, leaving them
absolutely helpless if attacked by hostile cavalry. It may
have originated from the fact that the driver, far into the
eighteenth century, had not been a soldier at all, but a
“waggoner,” a civilian without uniform or arms. It was
only in 1794 that the corps of Artillery Drivers was formed
upon this rather unpromising basis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Regimental Colours</div>

<p>This is probably the place in which mention should be
made of the standards under which the army fought.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a>
Cavalry banners or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">guidons</i> had just gone out—if used at
all in the Peninsular War, it was only in its first year.
Reports from the later years show that all regiments had
left them either at their depôt in England, or in some cases
at Lisbon. But infantry regiments, with few exceptions,
took their flags into the field, as was the custom with their
successors down to the last generation. It was only in the
1880’s that they finally ceased to be displayed on active
service. The Rifles, always destined to fight in extended
order, never had colours, and the regimental annals of
some Light Infantry corps (the 68th and 71st) show that
for similar reasons they had left their standards behind in
England. But this was not the case with all Light Infantry:
the famous 43rd and 52nd carried them all through the war.</p>

<p>Of the two battalion colours the one or “King’s Colour”
was a large Union Jack, with the regiment’s number on a
shield or medallion, often encompassed with a wreath, and
sometimes also with the badge of the corps, when such
existed. The second or Regimental colour was of the same
hue as the facings of the corps, and only had a small Union<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
Jack in its upper left corner, next the pole. On the plain
silk of the main surface of the flag were disposed the number
of the regiment, often in a wreath, and its badges and
battle-honours, where such existed. Since facings had
many hues, the main effect of the two flags was very
different, the large Union Jack of the King’s Colour being
contrasted with the yellow, green, crimson, or white, etc.,
of the Regimental Colour.</p>

<p>The colours were borne in battle by the two junior
ensigns of the battalion, who had assigned to them for
protection several colour-sergeants. It was the duty of
these non-commissioned officers to take charge of the flag
if the proper bearer were slain or hurt, and in many battles
both colours came out of action in sergeants’ hands. The
post of colour-sergeant was honourable but dangerous, for
the enemy’s fire always beat hardest about the standards
in the centre of the battalion line. Sergeant Lawrence of
the 40th notes, in his simple diary, that at Waterloo he was
ordered to the colours late in the day, because both the
ensigns and all the colour-sergeants had been hit. “Though
used to warfare as any one, this was a job I did not like.
There had been before me that day <em>fourteen</em> sergeants
already killed or wounded around them, and both staff and
colours were almost cut to pieces.”<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> This was, of course,
very exceptional carnage; but the posts of junior ensign and
colour-sergeant were always exceptionally dangerous.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX" class="vspace">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span class="subhead">THE COMMISSARIAT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>As I have already had occasion to remark, when dealing
with the central organization of the Peninsular Army,
of all the departments which had their representatives
at Head Quarters that which was under the charge of the
Commissary-General was the most important.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> It is not
too much to say that, when the long struggle began, the
whole future of the war depended on whether the hastily
organized and inexperienced Commissariat Department
could enable Wellington to keep his army concentrated,
and to move it freely in any direction.</p>

<p>Spain and Portugal are countries where large armies
cannot be supplied from local resources, except in a few
favoured districts. Any attempt to live on requisitions was
bound to fail in the end, as the French realized to their
sorrow, after a long series of endeavours to subsist on the
countryside in the Peninsula, as they were wont to do in
Italy or Germany. Wellington from the first forbade it,
and resolved that the main dependence of the troops must
be on regular stores brought up from the base of operations.
Requisitions were only a subsidiary resource; they could
only be made by an authorized commissary, and must be
paid for at once. It was his misfortune that specie was often
not forthcoming, and the payments had to be made by
Treasury orders or other paper, which the peasants who
received them found hard to negotiate. But payment in
some form was always made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">All-Importance of Convoys</div>

<p>At the best, requisitions were only a secondary aid, and
the army relied for the staple of its provisions on the stores
which the Commissary-General had to bring up from Lisbon
or other bases. This was a hard task for him, when it is
remembered that the cross roads of the Peninsula were
mule-tracks, on which heavy wheeled traffic could not pass;
and that the army was often operating at a distance of
150 or 200 miles from its depôts. Moreover, in 1809,
the staff of the Commissariat had all their work to learn—no
British army for many years had been operating in
heavy force, and for many months on end, in a thinly-peopled
continental theatre of war. The difficulty of
bringing up the daily food of the troops seemed at first
almost insuperable. At the end of the Talavera campaign
the men were well-nigh famished, simply because the
attempt had been made to depend more than was possible
on local resources, to the neglect of convoys from the base.
After this experience Wellington resolved that he must
live on his own stores, and this principle was remembered
throughout the war. Hence the work which fell on the
commissariat, in collecting and forwarding food from the
base, was appalling. Most of it had to be conveyed by
brigades of pack-mules with native drivers, who were hard
to manage and prone to desert. The rest came up on country
carts—ox-waggons for the most part. That mistakes and
delays occurred, that a brigade or a division was occasionally
foodless for several days, and forced to halt in the middle
of a critical operation, is not wonderful. But on the whole
after much toil and trouble the Commissariat succeeded in
doing its duty, and the length of time for which the British
army could keep concentrated was the envy of the French,
who, living on the country, were forced to disperse whenever
they had exhausted the resources of the particular
region in which they were massed.</p>

<p>All through the years 1811–12 the central fact in the
Peninsula was that if the French armies of Portugal and
the North concentrated at Salamanca and Rodrigo, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
if (on the other hand) those of Portugal and Andalusia
joined on the Guadiana, in the region of Badajoz and
Merida, the Anglo-Portuguese were too weak to face the
combination. Wellington had to abandon the offensive,
and to seek refuge behind the Portuguese frontier. But
when he did so, as in June, 1811, and again in September
of the same year, he knew that the overwhelming force
in front of him could not hold itself together for more than
a very short period of days. Troops brought from enormous
distances, and destitute of any adequate magazines or
transport, could not live on the countryside for more than
a limited period. They were forced to disperse, in order
to feed, and so the threatening conjunction passed, and,
when the enemy had drawn apart, the allied army could
once more abandon the defensive, and take some positive
project in hand. The same was the case in the late autumn
of 1812, during the retreat from Burgos. Wellington on this
occasion had on his hands the largest combination of French
troops that he ever faced—the four armies of Portugal,
the North, the Centre, and Andalusia were all pressing in
upon him. It would have been hopeless to fight, and so
retreat was persevered in, so long as the enemy continued
to advance. But Wellington knew that the progress of
the 100,000 men now pursuing him must inevitably come
to an end, for in their rapid course they could bring no
stores with them, and in the war-worn country between
Salamanca and Rodrigo they could obtain nothing. Where
his own troops, though returning toward their base and
their depôts, were hard put to it for food, the French must
be suffering even more. Wherefore he retreated, waiting
for the inevitable moment when the pursuit could be no
longer urged. It mattered little whether it stopped at
Salamanca, or a march or so beyond (as actually happened),
or whether it might get a little further, as far as the Portuguese
frontier. It was certain, within a period of days,
that it must break down. Meanwhile he himself was retreating
on to his stores, and could depend upon them:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
after Rodrigo the men were getting their full rations once
more.</p>

<p>The duties of the Commissariat may be divided into
three sections—the first was the accumulation of great
masses of sea-borne stores at the regular bases, the second
was the distribution of those stores to the troops at the
front by an immense system of convoys; the third and
subsidiary task was the supplementing of these base-stores,
by getting in what could be procured in the countryside,
where the army was operating; for, of course, every <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">fanega</i>
or <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">arroba</i> of food-stuff that could be obtained at the front
was helpful. It had not to be carried far, it saved convoy
work, and it kept the magazines at the base from depletion.
Yet, as has been already remarked, what was got in the
countryside was always considered as the secondary source
of supply; the main reliance was on the food-ships, which
poured into the base-depôt of Lisbon corn sought in
the ends of the earth, not only in such limited parts of
Europe as could be drawn upon in the days of the
Continental System, but in Morocco, Turkey in Asia, and
America.</p>

<p>The maintenance of the Peninsular War entirely depended
on the naval predominance of Great Britain in all
seas; if the army of Wellington had not been able to draw
freely on distant resources, his position would have been
little better than that of his French enemies. Hence it
was that, in one sense, the greatest danger that he ever
incurred was the American War of 1812–14, which turned
loose upon his line of communications, in the North Atlantic,
many scores of active and enterprising privateers, who
did considerable damage among British shipping, and for
the first time since the war began made the high seas
insecure. But fortunately the commencement of the
American War exactly synchronized with the beginnings
of Napoleon’s downfall, and the struggle in Europe took
a favourable turn just as the peril on the ocean came into
being. If the American War had broken out in 1809 or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
1810, its significance would have been of much higher
importance.</p>

<p>The normal condition of commissariat affairs, during
the first four years of the war, was that there were daily
arriving in Lisbon supplies of all sorts, not only food but
clothing, munitions, and weapons of war, which had to
be got forward to the army as quickly as possible. In
the winter of 1810–11, when the whole of Wellington’s
host lay concentrated behind (or later in advance of) the
Lines of Torres Vedras, the problem was comparatively
simple, as the troops were close to the magazines. But
during the remainder of the years 1811–12 the British divisions
were lying out at a long distance from their base—by
Guarda, Celorico, or Almeida, or at other times near
Merida, Campo Mayor, and Portalegre. In 1812, when
Wellington moved forward as far as Madrid and Burgos,
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">étapes</i> between the base-depôt and the field army
were even greater.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Water Transport</div>

<p>The Commissary-General’s duty was to see that convoys
went regularly to the front, so that the army should never
be in want. This was a hard business, since most of the
transfer had to be made on mule-back, and the rest on ox-carts
of primitive construction and small capacity. Water-carriage,
which would have been comparatively easy,
could only be utilized on a limited scale; the Tagus was
generally navigable to Abrantes, and when the main army
lay in Estremadura this was a great help, since stores could
be sent up in barges and country boats with much greater
ease than by road. When unloaded at Abrantes, they
had a comparatively short way to travel by mule or ox-cart
to Elvas or Portalegre. But usually only Hill’s two
divisions were on the Estremadura frontier, and Wellington
with the main force was somewhere on the Beira frontier,
in the direction of Guarda, Sabugal, and the Coa. These
regions are 150 miles or more from Lisbon, and the roads
beyond Coimbra on the one side and Abrantes on the
other were rugged and badly kept. It was a trying business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
to secure the constant and regular forwarding of the necessary
convoys, and the return of beasts and men to the
base, when they had discharged their loads at the front.
A very slight assistance was got by using the river Douro
as a secondary line of water carriage—but it was only navigable
to Peso da Regoa near Lamego, which was so far
from the Spanish frontier and the normal haunts of the
army, that little was gained by sending stores to Oporto
as a secondary base-depôt. In 1811 the only large consignments
forwarded on that line were the heavy guns
and ammunition, which were to form the siege-train that
Dickson was organizing at Villa da Ponte,<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> which is comparatively
close to Lamego, though the roads between
them were very bad. In 1812 Wellington’s engineers, by
patient blasting and dredging in the bed of the Douro,
made it navigable as far as Castro de Alva, which is forty
miles up-stream from Peso da Regoa, and lies not very
remote from Almeida. After this the Douro became much
more useful as a line of supply, and it was largely used for
the forwarding of stores before the opening of the campaign
of 1813. But, just as it had become available on a better
scale, Wellington started the great march to Vittoria,
whose success took him away for ever from Portugal.
During the last year of the war he suddenly shifted his
base, and made Santander and Passages his base-ports,
so that the improvements in the navigation of the Douro
were of no further utility.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mule-Train</div>

<p>A great part of the Commissary-General’s staff was kept
at Lisbon, with a smaller sub-department at Oporto,
receiving from the ships, unloading, and repacking the
immense stores that came to hand. Every few days a
convoy started for the front, under the charge of a deputy-assistant-commissary,
a commissariat-clerk, or some such
subordinate. It would usually consist of a large drove of
hired mules, worked by their owners, who generally acted together
in gangs or parties, of which a <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">capataz</i> or head-driver,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
chosen by his comrades, was the chief, and did the bargaining
with the commissariat authorities. The convoy
would probably consist of the gangs of five or six <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">capatazes</i>,
and would number many scores of beasts. The commissariat
official in charge had no easy task to make the
muleteers get over a reasonable daily stretch of road, and
to see that they did not steal from the stores, or (what was
not unknown when there was a quarrel) desert with their
beasts. When the convoy got near the front, it would
have to be provided with an escort—generally convalescents
returning to their battalions, or drafts newly arrived from
England. But the escorts were not an unmixed blessing—they
were terribly prone to picking and stealing from the
stores, with or without the connivance of the muleteers.
There was nearly always trouble when a small escort,
without an officer to keep his men in hand, got associated
with a mule train. Brawls were frequent between soldiers
and muleteers, and the assistant-commissary in charge
could not get the escort to obey him: sergeants looked
upon him as a mere civilian in a cocked hat, who might be
contemned. Nor was the task of such an unfortunate
official rendered more easy by the fact that, owing to sheer
want of hard cash, his muleteers were usually in long arrears
of their stipulated hire. They naturally grumbled, but on
the whole stuck to their service far more faithfully than
might have been expected; there were times when the
whole body of them were many months unpaid, yet only
a small proportion disappeared. Probably the fact that
they escaped the conscription by being registered as authorized
followers of the British Army had something to do with
their long-suffering: probably also real patriotism had some
share, for they all loyally hated the French, and were prone
to cut the throats of their wounded, if left unshepherded
near a recent battlefield.</p>

<p>Wheeled transport was much less satisfactory than the
mule trains for continuous movement. The British waggons
sent out to the Peninsula turned out to be quite useless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
for Portuguese by-roads. Wellington finally gave up all
idea of relying on them for load-carrying, and mainly
employed them for his sick and wounded. A few of the
“spring waggons” (as they were called to distinguish them
from the springless Portuguese vehicles)<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> were attached
to each brigade for the carriage of invalids, and the “Royal
Waggon Train” in the later years of the war seem to have
been almost treated as an ambulance corps. Certainly
the army would have been in evil case, if it had been forced
to rely on them for the moving of its food.</p>

<p>Such stores as did move upon wheels, and not upon
mule-back, were carried on Portuguese ox-waggons, to
which Wellington was compelled to have recourse for want
of better vehicles. These were very primitive structures—the
sides of wicker work, the wheels made of solid circles
of wood bounded with iron, turning axle and all, which made
their grinding noise almost intolerable. The excruciating
thrills caused to the ear by a train of such carts are mentioned
with disgust by nearly every Peninsular diarist, on his first
introduction to life at the front. The only advantages
of ox-waggons were that they were light, easy to repair,
and specially built for the bad roads of the country: moreover,
every peasant knew how to drive them, or to mend
them at a pinch. Their weak points were that they were
intolerably slow—two miles an hour was a full allowance—and
that they were too small to carry much. However,
they had to serve for want of better vehicles—and the
army could not have lived without their service. An
immense amount of them were employed, some on regular
and long terms of hire, as part of the permanent transport
of the army, others in a more temporary way, by requisition
from the district. These last were always difficult to
manage; professional muleteers would not object to travel,
but impressed peasants loathed quitting their own district,
fearing that they might be taken far afield—perhaps into
Spain—before they were released. They were always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
trying to abscond with their precious bullocks, abandoning
the comparatively worthless cart and its stores. A picture
of the sort may be taken from Hennegan’s lively narrative
of a march in 1809, when he had to take an unwilling
train of “embargoed” waggoners across the mountains of
Northern Beira.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Desertion of Drivers</div>

<p>“Leaning on their oxen at nightfall, they contemplated
in mute dismay on one side the gigantic hill which they
had just descended, on the other the roaring torrent of the
Douro, which in its impetuous course seemed to threaten
with destruction the temerity that would brave its power.
The <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Santa Marias</i> of some were answered by the more
emphatic <em xml:lang="es" lang="es">carajos!</em> of others, but even these died away
before the necessities of the moment, and unyoking the
oxen, to afford them the shelter of trees, the drivers spread
their large cloaks in the empty sheds, and soon in sleep
seemed to forget their disappointment. The poor men,
taken from their homes for our service, risked in the loss
of their oxen the only means of support for themselves and
families.</p>

<p>“The following morning, however, presented a curious
scene. There stood the wains, securely packed, but looking
as if the earth had brought them forth, for no vestige
remained of the means by which they had been brought
to this lonely spot. The rumour of the proximity of the
French had determined these Portuguese on sacrificing the
wains, if only they could ensure the preservation of themselves
and oxen. What was now to be done?”<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the non-plussed guardian of the
deserted convoy had to remain motionless for many days,
risking the possible arrival of the French, till at last he
procured boats on the Douro, and shipped his charge
down to Oporto. Hennegan’s peasants got away with their
bullocks—he and his escort were evidently sleepy and unsuspecting:
but often a good watch was kept on the teams,
and sentries placed over them. In such cases, if the weather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
was bad, or the French too near, the drivers would often
sacrifice even their loved beasts, and simply abscond
themselves, abandoning their means of livelihood.</p>

<p>It says much for the general zeal of the Commissariat
Department that, even with such difficulties about them,
they usually succeeded in keeping the army supplied with
food. Occasionally there were desperate pinches of starvation,
when the army had out-marched its convoys—this,
for example, happened on the Alva in March, 1811, when
half of the army, in pursuit of Masséna, had to stop dead
for several days, because their rapid advance had left the
slow-moving mule-trains several marches behind. To press
the French would have been most profitable—but if the
troops had gone on, through the depopulated land before
them, they must have perished of sheer want of food, and
Wellington reluctantly halted till the convoys began to
creep up to the front. Another period of empty stomachs
was seen during the retreat from Burgos, from the opposite
cause; forced to give back, Wellington started his train
betimes for Ciudad Rodrigo, to get it out of the proximity
of the oncoming enemy. Hence the rear divisions, who
had to contain the pursuers and to move slowly, found,
when they had eaten what was in their haversacks, that
the convoys were all several marches ahead of them. They
suffered terribly, and existed for two days mainly on acorns
gleaned from the oak forests through which they were
marching. But mischances of this kind were hardly to
be considered the fault of the Commissariat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Resources of the Country</div>

<p>As I have already had to remark, the duty of the officers
of this department did not merely consist in bringing up
and distributing food forwarded from the base depôts.
They had also, as a subsidiary resource, to get what they
could out of the countryside. A good assistant-commissary
was always casting about, through the villages
on either side of the route of the brigade to which he was
attached, to find cattle and corn that could be bought.
He was forced to pay for them, since Wellington strictly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
forbade requisition without value given. When the commissary
had dollars the matter was not so difficult, for the
peasants were generally ready to sell. But when, as often
happened, the military chest was empty, and payment
could only be made in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vales</i>—paper promises to pay—the
inhabitants soon got wind of the fact, hid their corn, and
drove their oxen up into the hills. The good commissary
was the man, who, under such circumstances could discover
and get possession of the concealed resources of the
land. But even if there was money in hand, a good deal
of tact was required in dealing with the natives, and it was
not every one who would make the most of his store of
cash or paper for the benefit of his brigade. How the
ingenious man worked may be gathered from a note of
Commissary Dallas, dealing with a march through Northern
Andalusia in 1812.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></p>

<p>“Having made careful inquiries as to the properties
and farms which lay at some distance to right or left of
the road, our plan was to seek them, not saying a word
of our object, but simply asking hospitality. I do not
remember that this was ever refused, though sometimes
we failed to gain anything. We usually began with talking
of the horrors of the French, of which Andres had many
terrible chapters to relate. This led to expressions of grief
as to the ravages that the enemy had made: by degrees
we introduced a word of rejoicing that some people had so
well known how to hide their property from such rapacious
robbers. It often happened that at the word <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">esconder</i>, to hide,
there were indications on the countenances of some of the
party which led to further inquiries. On many occasions
we drew out hints from various members of the community
which enabled us to jump to conclusions, which surprised
other members, as to the concealment of stores of wheat,
barley, Indian corn, etc. The difficulty was to obtain
access to the supplies, when we had become aware of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
existence; but I had power to give a good price, and was
armed with plenary authority of Spanish officials to say
that my drafts would be honoured in due course.</p>

<p>“An incident or two will illustrate the manner in which
we got supplies. At one distant solitary house of poor appearance
Andres discovered that, while everything looked
poverty-stricken about the place, there was somewhere in
a thick wood a barn which contained concealed stores.
I told the mistress of the house of the very high price that
I would give for wheat, Indian corn, or forage. In the
grey October dawn I was awoke by her husband, who told
me he could supply what I wanted, if I would give a certain
price, which he named. I said that I must see the supplies
before I gave money. He bade me rise, and he would
show me. He led me two miles to a thick wood, in which
was a deep ravine; here he brought me safely to a receptacle
of much hidden store, which I took at his own price, and
gave him the proper document. In one part of the Sierra
Morena we heard of a considerable flock of sheep secreted
in the depth of a forest. I obtained the permission of the
owner to possess them for a certain price <em>if I could get them</em>,
for he himself could not point out the spot where they
were to be found. After gathering what information I
could, I set forth in the hope of finding them, and did so by
following a track of sheep till I arrived in the middle of
the flock. I told the two shepherds that I had purchased
them—they were doubtful and one very refractory. But
at last one of them drove the sheep to the open plain outside
the forest, and then disappeared among the trees with his
dog, leaving me to drive the flock as I could. It was no
easy task—but I got them into an enclosure a considerable
way off.”<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Unpopular Commissary</div>

<p>If these were the experiences of a Commissariat official
who had been three years in Spain, and knew the language
well, it is easy to guess how inefficient a newly landed clerk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
or assistant must have been, when he was sent to sweep
the countryside for what he could discover. It was a
thankless task—often the seeker came back empty, to be
frowned upon by his departmental chief and the brigadier.
When he did discover food, it was taken for granted, and
he was little thanked. The fighting men seem to have
had a general prejudice against their providers—they were
accused of being timid, arrogant, and selfish, and the
embezzlements of certain black sheep were made to cover a
general charge of dishonesty against the whole tribe, which
was far from being justified. Misfeasance there certainly
was, when an unscrupulous commissary credited a peasant
with more <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">fanegas</i> than he had received, and divided the
balance of cash with the seller. But on the whole the
work was well done, despite of the many complaints of the
military—from Wellington himself downwards. That the
Peninsular War was successfully maintained in 1810–11–12
was surely, at bottom, the work of the much-maligned
commissaries, and the motley band of ill-paid and sometimes
ruffianly muleteers and waggoners, who, through a thousand
difficulties,<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> generally got the biscuit and the rum-barrels,
the droves of bullocks, and the packs of clothing and shoes,
to their appointed destination.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX" class="vspace">CHAPTER XX<br />

<span class="subhead">A NOTE ON THINGS SPIRITUAL</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In the first chapter of this volume I had occasion to remark
that Wellington’s army had in its ranks a considerable
sprinkling of men of religion, and that three or four of
the better Peninsular memoirs were written by them.
Some were Methodists, some Churchmen, so that both
sides of the great spiritual movement which had started
about the middle of the eighteenth century were represented
in their diaries. The spiritual side of the soldier’s life
during the great war has had so little written about it,
that a few illustrative pages on this topic must not be
omitted.</p>

<p>We may trace the existence of the admirable class of
men who have left us these memoirs to two separate
causes. The one, of course, was the way in which the
movement started by the Wesleys had influenced all
ranks of life, from the lowest upward. Its effects had
not been confined to avowed Methodists, but had led to
the rise of the Evangelical party within the Church of
England, which was developing very rapidly all through
the days of the Great War. But I think that even if the
Wesleys had never lived, there would yet have been a
strong reaction in favour of godly living and the open
profession of Christianity, in consequence of the blasphemous
antics of the French Revolution. Nothing in
that movement so disgusted Englishmen (even those of
them who were not much given to practical religion) as the
story of the “Goddess of Reason,” enthroned on the high-altar
of Notre Dame, at the time when an orgy of bloodshed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
was making odious the flatulent talk about humanitarianism
and liberty which was the staple of Revolutionary oratory.
The peculiar combination of insult to Christianity, open
evil living, and wholesale judicial murder, which distinguished
the time of the Terror, had an effect on observers
comparable to nothing else that has been seen in modern
times. Even men who had not hitherto taken their
religion very seriously, began to think that a hell was
logically necessary in the scheme of creation for beings
like Chaumette or Hébert, Fouquier Tinville or Carrier of
the <cite>Noyades</cite>. And, we may add, a personal devil was
surely required, to account for the promptings of insane
wickedness which led to the actions of such people. A
tightening up of religious observances, such as the use of
family prayer and regular attendance at Church, was a
marked feature of the time. It required some time for
the movement to spread, but its effect was soon observable.
It naturally took shape in adhesion to Evangelical societies
within the Church of England, or Methodist societies
without it; since these were the already existing nuclei
round which those whose souls had been stirred by the
horrors in France and the imminent peril of Great Britain
would group themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of the French Revolution</div>

<p>Very soon the day was over in which “enthusiasm”
was the dread of all normal easy-going men. Something
more than the eighteenth century religious sentimentalism,
and vague spiritual philosophy, was needed for a nation
which had to fight for life and empire against the French
Republic and all its works. Those methods of thought
were sufficiently discredited by the fact that there was a
touch of Rousseau in them: it was easy to look over the
Channel, and see to what a belief in some nebulous Supreme
Being, and in the perfectibility and essential righteousness
of mankind at large, might lead. The God of the Old
Testament was a much more satisfactory object of worship
to the men who had to face the Jacobin, and Calvinism
has always proved a good fighting creed. If ever there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
was a justification for a belief that the enemy were in a
condition of complete reprobation, and that to smite
them was the duty of every Christian man, it was surely
at this time. The conviction of the universality of sin
and the natural wickedness of the human heart was the
exact opposite and antidote to the optimistic philosophy
of the eighteenth century, and to its belief that man is
essentially a benevolent being, and that if he sometimes
breaks out into deplorable violence “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tout comprendre est
tout pardonner</i>.” As a working hypothesis for an enemy
of the French Revolution the Calvinistic theory had
everything in its favour.</p>

<p>The army, like English society in general, contained an
appreciable proportion of those whom the stress and terror
of the times had made anxious about their souls. Some
took their religious experience quietly, and found sufficient
edification in accepted forms. Many, however, filled with
a fervent belief in original sin and in the blackness of their
own hearts, only got comfort by “conversion” in the prevalent
form of the day, and in subsequent reliance on
complete Justification by Faith.</p>

<p>“Conversion” was frequently a matter of dire spiritual
agony and wrestling, often accompanied by fits of horrible
depression, which were generally fought down, but sometimes
ended in religious mania. Sergeant Donaldson of the
94th, whom I have often had to quote in other chapters,
tells a terrible tale from his own regiment of a man whose
weak point had been a violent temper, and a tendency to
use his fists. Being under strong religious emotion, and
having determined never again to offend in this way, he
had the misfortune to break out once more in unjustifiable
blows, administered to his peasant landlord in the village
of Ustaritz. Ashamed of his backsliding he fell into a
fit of despair, and brooding over the text “if thy right hand
offend thee, cut it off,” he resolved that this was the only
cure for his irascibility. Whereupon he went, and without
any display of emotion or eccentricity, very quietly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
borrowed a felling-axe from one of the regimental pioneers,
placed his right hand upon a window-sill, and cut it off
with a single blow delivered very dexterously with his
left. He then went and reported his act and its reason to
the regimental surgeon, with great calmness and lucidity.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Agonies of Conversion</div>

<p>Such incidents as this were rare among those who were
undergoing the process of Conversion, but it was generally
accompanied by long spasms of conviction of sin, when,
as one memoir-writer records, “all the crimes of his life
passed before him in black array, when he felt that if he
could but bury himself in a cave or den of the earth, and
forego all intercourse with mankind, it would be to purchase
pardon and peace easily and cheaply.... Life was but
the dreadful expectation of that fatal hour when the
fiend would be commissioned to seize and carry off the
guilty soul to its abode of everlasting misery.”<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> Another
diarist records that, as he went down toward the great
breach of Badajoz, he was repeating to himself very forcibly,
“You will be in hell before daylight” all the time, till he
received a disabling wound. This rifleman, when he
experienced conversion, received therewith an unexpected
gift of metrical exposition. His autobiography is curiously
sprinkled with his impromptu verses such <span class="locked">as—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Then why let our minds be encumbered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Bout what such poor worms may befall,<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="in0">And <span class="locked">again—</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>
</div>
<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
This ecstatic confidence of the converted man is very
clearly expressed in many a little book. A Guards’ sergeant,
whose memoirs I have had occasion to quote in earlier
chapters, mentions that, all through the hard experience of
his brigade at Talavera, he was comforted by the thought
that, however disastrous the day was looking, “the Lord
can save us now.”</p>

<p>“Standing between the enemy and my own men,
with the shot ploughing up the ground all about me, the
Lord kept me from all fear, and I got back to my place in
the line without injury and without agitation. Indeed,
who should be so firm as the Christian soldier, who has
the assurance in his breast that to depart and to be with
Christ is far better than to continue toiling here below?”<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a>
On another occasion this diarist, in a long waiting spell
before a dangerous disembarkation, found Wesley’s two
hundred and twenty-seventh hymn running in his mind
all the morning, to the inexpressible comfort of his soul
during an anxious time.</p>

<p>This kind of comfortable ecstasy did not by any means
preclude a ready and competent employment of musket
and bayonet. One or two of the notable personal exploits
of the Peninsular War were done by “saints.” There is
a special mention in several diaries, regimental and general,
of John Rae, of the 71st, a well-known Methodist, who
at the combat of Sobral (October 14, 1810), being the
last man of the skirmishers of his battalion to retire, was
beset by three French <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tirailleurs</i>, on whom he turned, and
shot one and bayoneted the other two in the twinkling
of an eye. He received a medal for his conduct from his
brigadier, who had been an eye-witness of the affair.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Wellington’s Views on Religion</div>

<p>The attitude of Wellington toward religion at large,
and religious soldiers in particular, was very much what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
one might have expected from his peculiar blend of personal
characteristics. He was a sincere believer in Christianity
as presented by the Church of England, but he had not
been in the least affected by recent evangelical developments,
and his belief was of a rather dry and official sort; an officer
who took to public preaching and the forming of religious
societies was only two or three degrees less distasteful to
him than an officer who was foul-mouthed in his language
and openly contemned holy things. I fancy that the
Duke would have been inclined to regard both as “ungentlemanly.”
Religion with him was the due recognition
of the fact that man has a Creator, who has imposed upon
him a code of laws and a system of morality which it is
man’s duty to remember, and so far as he may, to observe.
He was quite ready to acknowledge that he had his own
failings, but trusted that they were not unpardonable ones.
The two or three Evangelical enthusiasts who had the
courage to tackle him in his later days on the subject of
his soul, got small profit thereby.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></p>

<p>It is highly to his credit that he made from 1810 onward
a serious attempt to organize a system of brigade chaplaincies
for his army, and to see that the men should not lack
the possibility of public worship. Down to that year the
chaplains’ department had been much neglected: large
expeditions had gone out without a single clergyman
attached, and in the first Peninsular Army of 1808 there
had been very few—though two of them, Ormsby and
Bradford, happen to have left interesting books behind
them, the latter’s beautifully illustrated by sketches.
Wellington complained that the provision that he found
in 1809 was wholly inadequate, asked for and obtained an
additional establishment, and made arrangements for
regular Sunday services in each brigade.</p>

<p>The letter of February 6, 1811, in which he explains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
his views to the Adjutant General at the Horse Guards is
a very characteristic document. “The army should have
the advantage of religious instruction, from a knowledge
that it is the greatest support and aid to military discipline
and order.” But there are not enough chaplains, and
those that exist are not always “respectable.” The
prospects of a military chaplain are not attractive enough;
on retirement he is much worse off than he would have been
“if he had followed any other line of the clerical profession
besides the army.” Hence few good men are obtained.
For want of sufficiently numerous and influential official
teachers, spontaneous religious life has broken out in the
army. There are three Methodist meetings in the 1st
Division alone. In the 9th regiment two officers are preaching,
in despite of their colonels’ dissuasions.</p>

<p>“The meeting of soldiers in their cantonments to sing
psalms, or to hear a sermon read by one of their comrades is,
in the abstract, perfectly innocent; it is a better way of
spending their time than many others to which they are
addicted. But it may become otherwise, and yet, till the
abuse has made some progress, their commanding officer
would have no knowledge of it, nor could he interfere.”</p>

<p>Official religious instruction is the proper remedy. A
“respectable clergyman” is wanted, who “by his personal
influence and advice, and by that of true religion, would
moderate the zeal and enthusiasm of those people, and
prevent meetings from becoming mischievous, even if he
could not prevail upon them to discontinue them entirely.”
Wherefore the Adjutant General must provide for a larger
establishment of “respectable and efficient clergymen.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chaplains</div>

<p>The Horse Guards complied at once: chaplains, it was
replied, should be sent out “selected with the utmost care
and circumspection by the first prelates of the country.”
Their pay was raised, and they were directed to conclude
every service with a short practical sermon, suited to the
habits and understanding of soldiers. “Good preaching,”
adds the Adjutant General, “is more than ever required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
at a time peculiarly marked by the exertions and interference
of sectaries of various denominations.”<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p>The chaplains duly appeared. There were good men
among them, but they were not, taken as a whole, a complete
success. Perhaps the idea, equally nourished by
Wellington and by the Horse Guards, that “respectable”
clergymen rather than enthusiasts should be drafted out,
was the cardinal mistake; the sort of men that were really
wanted at the front were precisely the enthusiasts, like that
Rev. T. Owen (afterwards secretary of the British and
Foreign Bible Society), of whom we are told that he was in
days of action so far forward in the field that officers
warned him that he would infallibly be killed. His reply
was that his primary duty was “to be of service to those
now departing this life.”<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> This sort of laudable energy,
I am bound to say, does not seem to have been the most
common characteristic of the chaplains, if we may trust
the diaries of the time.</p>

<p>A good many of them were sent straight out from a
country curacy to the front, had no special knowledge of
soldiers and their ways, and were appalled at having to
face the great facts of life and death in their crudest form
day after day. There is one distressing picture of a young
clergyman suddenly confronted in the guard-tent with
five deserters who were to be shot that afternoon. They
were all criminals who had been actually taken in the
French ranks, fighting against their old comrades, at the
storm of Ciudad Rodrigo. The chaplain helplessly read
prayers at them, felt that he could do no more with callous
ruffians who had met the death-sentence with an oath,
and followed them to the execution-place looking very
uncomfortable, quite useless, and much ashamed of
himself.</p>

<p>It was almost as trying, if not so horrible, to be tackled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
by a Calvinist in the throes of conversion, who gave glowing
pictures of hell-fire, and asked for the means of avoiding
it, refusing to take as an answer any dole of chapters from
the New Testament or petitions from the Prayer Book.
Here is a picture of the situation from the point of view of
the penitent, Quartermaster Surtees, whom I have already
had occasion to quote.</p>

<p>“From the clergyman, though a kind and sympathizing
man, I, alas! derived but little benefit. He did not direct
me to the only source of a sin-sick being’s hopes—the Lamb
of God which taketh away the sins of the world. He tried
to make my hopes centre more on good resolutions, and
after-doings. How thankfully would I have accepted the
true method of salvation pointed out in the gospel; but
already I was but too much (as the natural man always is)
inclined to expect pardon from the acts of penitence which,
if God spared me, I intended to perform. The kind
gentleman wrote me out prayers, and seemed much interested
in my welfare. But reading and praying seemed
more like an irksome task than an exercise which brought
spiritual profit.... Indeed the Scriptures were still at
this time a ‘sealed book’ to me; until the grace of God
has dispelled our darkness there is no light in anything.”<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></p>

<p>Clearly the Quartermaster had come upon one of those
sensible and commonplace clergy whom Wellington had
requisitioned from the Chaplain-general’s department,
when he wanted an Evangelist who would have preached
to him Justification by Faith in its simplest form.</p>

<p>There are a good many humorous anecdotes concerning
the race of Chaplains preserved in the Peninsular diaries,
not for the most part imputing to them any serious moral
failing—though several are accused of having become
“Belemites,”<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> and of shirking the front—but tending to
prove that they often failed to rise to the occasion in their
difficult calling. This was indeed to be expected when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
most of them had not the least knowledge of military life
and customs, and were wandering about for many months
in a world quite new to them. Clearly only men of experience
should have been sent—but (as Wellington remarks
in one of his letters) the pay offered was so small that only
enthusiasts or very poor men could be expected to take
it—and enthusiasts, for other reasons, the commander-in-chief
did not like. The soldier seems often to have been
struck by the helplessness of the chaplain—he let himself
be robbed by his servants, wandered outside the picquets
and got captured by the French, or was deceived by obvious
hypocrites. There is one ridiculous story of a young
clergyman who, when first brought forward to take a
brigade Sunday service, and placed behind the big-drum,
which was to serve him as a sort of central mark, mistook
its function for that of a pulpit, and endeavoured to mount
upon it, with disastrous results, and to the infinite laughter
of the congregation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Methodists</div>

<p>Not unfrequently the chaplains fell out with the
Methodists among their flocks. They had been specially
imported by Wellington in order that they might discourage
the prayer meetings—“getting up little conventicles” as
one of them called these assemblies. “The Church service
is sufficient for the instruction of mankind,” said another,
and “the zeal for preaching” tended to self-sufficiency
and incipient pharisaism. On the whole, however, there
was no regular or normal opposition between Church of
England and Methodist soldiers; they were in such a
minority among the godless that it would have been absurd
for them to have quarrelled. The Methodists regularly
received the sacrament from the chaplains along with the
churchmen, and the latter were frequently to be found
at the prayer meetings of the former.</p>

<p>Sergeant Stevenson’s memoir, a mine of useful information
in this respect, informs us that the regular organized
prayer meeting of the Wesleyans in the 1st Division was
begun in a gravel-pit just outside the walls of Badajoz, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
September, 1809, and never ceased from that time forward.
During the long sojourn behind the Lines of Torres Vedras
it was held for many weeks in a large wine-press, holding
more than a hundred men, behind the village of Cartaxo,
quite close to Wellington’s headquarters, where indeed
the hymns sung could be clearly heard. There were
similar associations in other divisions, some mainly Church
of England, some (as in the 79th regiment) Presbyterian.
Stevenson says that he never heard of any opposition on
the part of commanding officers, save in the case of one
captain, whose preaching was finally ended by a course of
persecution on the part of his colonel. But of course the
“saints” had to endure a good deal of ridicule from their
comrades, more especially those of them who took occasion
to testify against drunkenness or blasphemy. Stevenson
gives a verse of his own, which he says that he pasted up
in the sergeants’ room of the 3rd Guards, to discourage
profane swearing at large.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“It chills the blood to hear the Blest Supreme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rashly appealed to on each trifling theme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maintain your rank: vulgarity despise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To swear is neither <em>brave</em>, <em>polite</em>, nor <em>wise</em>.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>We may observe a certain canny appeal to the self-respect
of the non-commissioned officer, in the insinuation
that by blasphemy he lowers himself to the ranks, and is
guilty of vulgarity and want of politeness. It is to be
feared that these couplets might have been not inappropriately
hung up in the mess rooms of certain regiments
whose colonels were by no means choice in their language.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Soldier-Parsons</div>

<p>Among the senior officers of the Peninsular Army
there were a good number who were not merely like
Wellington, conformists of an official sort, but zealous
Christians, such were Hill, Le Marchant,<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> Colborne, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
John Beckwith—the Light Division colonel, who devoted
his later years to taking care of the Waldenses of Piedmont,
among whom he settled down in the evening of his life.
Quite a sprinkling of the younger officers took orders
when the war was over, after the great disbandment of
1816–17, when all the second battalions were disembodied.
Such were three men who have left us excellent Peninsular
diaries, Gleig of the 85th, the author of “The Subaltern,”
and other works, afterwards Chaplain-General to the forces;
Dallas, who made a great name as an evangelist at Burford,
was another soldier-parson; Boothby, who wrote a good
journal concerning Maida, Corunna, and Talavera, was a
third. The type generally ran to strong Evangelicalism,
as was natural, considering that this was the really live
and vigorous element in the Church of that day.</p>

<p>It is clear that the religious condition of regiments
varied extremely—that in some the influence of serious
and devout officers and men was large, in others practically
invisible. The character of the colonel made some difference
for good or bad, but I imagine that more depended on the
existence or non-existence of some small knot of officers
or sergeants who did not fear to let their views be known,
and formed a nucleus around which steady men gathered.
Their names are mostly forgotten, the record of their
witnessing has perished, or emerges only in some obscure
corner of a little-read biography or an old religious magazine.
I could wish that some sympathetic hand could devote a
whole book to collecting and recording that which I have
only been able to touch upon in this short chapter. It is a
side of the life of the Peninsular Army which well deserves
recording, since without some notice of it the picture of
military society during the great war is wholly incomplete.</p>

A consideration of the prefixed table of “establishments” shows
the following results. Putting aside the regiments with many
battalions (the 1st, 14th, 27th, 60th, 95th), the remainder fall into
two-battalion and single-battalion corps.</p>

<p>Of the 61 double-battalion <span class="locked">regiments—</span></p>

<p class="in0 in4 p1 b1">
 9 were at a strength of 2250 or thereabouts.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a><br />
17 were at a strength of 2031 or thereabouts.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a><br />
16 were at a strength of 1820 or thereabouts.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a><br />
12 were at a strength of 1610 or thereabouts.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a><br />
 7 were at a strength of under 1600.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a>
</p>

<p>All the regiments on the two higher establishments (with one
exception) had both battalions on active service in 1809, either
one in the Indies and one in Europe, or both in Europe. Hence
it was necessary to keep them at a very high figure.</p>

<p>Those with 1820 or 1610 men were nearly all regiments which
had one battalion on active service and one on home service, though
a very few had both overseas (such as the 18th, 34th, 39th, 62nd);
in such cases the 2nd battalion, though on service, was very weak.</p>

<p>The two-battalion corps with under 1600 men were almost
invariably regiments which had one battalion in the Indies, worked
down to very low numbers by disease, and had failed to keep up
its strength (the 15th, 25th, 96th in the West, the 59th, 69th in the
East Indies).</p>

<p>The 37 single-battalion regiments stood on the following
<span class="locked">establishments—</span></p>

<p class="in0 in4 p1 b1">
 6 were at a strength of 1126 or thereabouts.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a><br />
13 were at a strength of 940 or thereabouts.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a><br />
15 were at a strength of 700–730 or thereabouts.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a><br />
 3 were at a strength of under 600.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a>
</p>

<p>Those corps on the two higher establishments are either actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
serving, or are designated for immediate service abroad, and have
therefore their establishments fixed high. Those on the lower
establishments (730 or under) fall into two classes: either they
are regiments in the East or West Indies which have died down to
a low figure [<i>e.g.</i> 16th, 37th, 46th, 54th, 55th, 65th, 68th, 70th,
86th] or they are battalions quartered in peaceful stations and not
expected to be sent on active service, [<i>e.g.</i> 41st, 99th, 100th, 103rd,
in Canada and Bermuda] or at home [74th, 75th, 77th, 85th, 94th].
All the last-named five, on home service, were raised to a higher
establishment and sent to the front in 1810–12.</p>

<p>It will be noted that of the one hundred and three 1st battalions,
or single-battalion regiments, a great many were not available, viz.
twenty-one in the East Indies, twenty-one in the West Indies
(including Bermuda), eleven in the Mediterranean Garrisons, five
at the Cape of Good Hope, six in Canada, two in (or bound
for) New South Wales. There were only twenty-five 1st battalions
at home, and of these twenty had served under Moore in the
Corunna retreat and then went on the Walcheren expedition, so that
in 1809 they were unavailable. Three more battalions which had
not served under Moore had shared in the same descent on the
Scheldt (74th, 77th, 85th). There were actually only two single-battalion
corps which had neither gone to Corunna nor to Walcheren
and were available at home (75th and 94th).<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> In the way of the
strongly organized first battalions, therefore, there was absolutely
nil to send to Wellington in 1809 save Craufurd’s three Light
Infantry battalions, which though they had been with Moore in
January were back in the Peninsula by July (1/43rd, 1/52nd,
1/95th).</p>

<p>It is easy to see, therefore, that there was the greatest possible
difficulty in finding battalions with which Wellesley’s Peninsular
Army could be reinforced. Of troops which had not gone to Walcheren
there were left in Great Britain only the 75th and 94th,
with twenty-eight 2nd (or junior) battalions which had not joined in
the expedition to the Scheldt. These were almost without exception
very weak units, the first battalions of ten of these were in the
Indies, then of five more already in the Peninsula, all their strength
was used up in keeping their senior battalions full, of the remaining
thirteen only two (2/5th 2/34th, 2/38th), were strong enough to
be sent to Portugal. The reinforcements which Wellington was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
given in the autumn of 1809 and the summer of 1810 were largely
scraped up from foreign garrisons—the 1/7th from Nova Scotia,
the 1/11th from Madeira, the 1/57th from Gibraltar. But in 1810
Walcheren battalions began to come out, such as the 3/1st, 1/9th,
1/50th, 1/71st, 1/79th, and to load Wellington’s hospitals with ague-stricken
convalescents. For later reinforcements see Chapter VII.</p>

<p>N.B.—The Second Batts. Coldstream and 3rd Foot Guards both sent their
flank companies to Walcheren. The troops sent to Cadiz early in 1810 were
detachments, viz. 4 companies of the 2/1st Guards, 3 of the 2/2nd, 3 of the 2/3rd.</p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS CORPS.</h3>

<p>In addition to the regular units shown in these lists, there are on
the estimates of 1809 twelve veteran battalions, with effectives
ranging from 693 to 1129, and eight garrison battalions, mostly with
an establishment of 906. Most of these were at home, but a few in
the Mediterranean garrisons.</p>

<p>There were also the foreign corps of Meuron, de Roll, Watteville,
Dillon, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Chasseurs Britanniques</i>, Royal Malta, Royal Corsicans and
the Sicilian regiment, all in the Mediterranean, with the York Light
Infantry, York Rangers, and Royal West India Rangers in the
West Indies. These were all single battalion corps ranging from
1361 men (de Roll) to 694 (York L. I.). The black regiments, eight
West India battalions with 1125 men each, could only be used in
their own regions.</p>

<p>Of the King’s German Legion there were at home the two Heavy
Dragoon Regiments with an establishment of 694 each, and the 2nd
and 3rd Hussars, with the same numbers. The 3rd Hussars were
just back from the Corunna Retreat: the 2nd went to Walcheren.
Of the ten infantry battalions, four (1st, 2nd, 5th, 7th Line) were
with the Peninsular Field Army, as was the 1st Hussars; four (3rd,
4th, 6th, 8th Line) were in Sicily; 1st and 2nd Light battalions (just
back from Corunna) were at home, and went to Walcheren. Four
battalions had establishments of 1062, six of 902, of all ranks.</p>

<p class="hang2">The detached companies of 5/60th at Talavera were with
I A, I B, II A, IV A, IV B.</p>

<p class="hang0">Subsequent changes were as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Cavalry.</i> 20th Light Dragoons and detachment 3rd Hussars
K.G.L., left the Peninsula before the end of July.</p>

<p>By June 21 a new brigade, C, was added, under G. Anson,
composed of 23rd Light Dragoons and 1st Hussars K.G.L.</p>

<p>On November 1 Granby Calcroft was commanding A for
Fane, absent.</p>

<p>By November 24 1st Dragoons (who arrived at Lisbon
in October) replaced the 16th Light Dragoons in B, now
under Slade, as Cotton was assisting Payne in command of
the division; 16th Light Dragoons were transferred to
C <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice</i> 23rd Light Dragoons, ordered home after their
losses at Talavera.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>1st Division.</i> 1/40th, from Seville, replaced 2/9th before June 21,
2/9th going to Gibraltar and relieving 1/61st, who joined
before Talavera, on which 1/40th were transferred to IV B.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
After Talavera 2/24th and 2/42nd were added to I B,
2/83rd being sent down to Lisbon.</p>

<p>At Talavera, H. Campbell was wounded, Stopford replacing
him in command of the division and brigade, but
from November 8 to December 15, Hulse had the brigade.
Langwerth having been killed at Talavera, Beck of 1st
Line K.G.L. succeeded to his brigade, but the two K.G.L.
brigades were amalgamated under Löw from November 1.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>2nd Division.</i> By June 21 Tilson (from III B) had taken over
Hill’s own brigade. Before Talavera 1/48th (arrived at
Lisbon June 22, on being relieved at Gibraltar by 2/30th)
had been added to II B.</p>

<p>In September, a new brigade, C, under Catlin Craufurd,
was added, composed of 2/28th, 2/34th, 2/39th, and about
the same time 2/31st (from III A) was added to II A. By
November 1, 1/57th (from Gibraltar) replaced 1st Detachments
in II B, the Battalions of Detachments having been
broken up.</p>

<p>From December 15 on II A was under command of
Duckworth of 2/48th.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>3rd Division.</i> Tilson, moving to II A, was replaced by Donkin
(June 21).</p>

<p>Before Talavera 2/24th replaced 3/27th (sent down to
Lisbon) in III A.</p>

<p>Mackenzie was killed at Talavera, and the division passed
under the command of R. Craufurd, whose brigade, 1/43rd,
1/52nd and 1/95th, arrived just too late for the battle, and
was apparently added to the division in place of Mackenzie’s
brigade which was amalgamated with Donkin’s. On
September 15, 2/87th was ordered down to Lisbon for
garrison duty, 2/24th being transferred to II B and 2/31st
to II A about the same time.</p>

<p>In October, Donkin gave up his brigade, Mackinnon
obtaining command.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>4th Division.</i> Myers of 2/7th seems to have commanded IV A
for A. Campbell.</p>

<p>By Talavera 1/40th had been added to IV B, of which
Kemmis had taken command vice Sontag.</p>

<p>At Talavera A. Campbell was wounded, and had to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
home, the division being without a definite G.O.C. till the
arrival of Lowry Cole in October.</p>

<p>In September 1/11th (arrived at Lisbon from Madeira in
August) was added to IV A. On the Battalions of Detachments
being sent home (October), 3/27th, in garrison at
Lisbon since after the Douro, replaced the 2nd Battalion in
IV B.</p>

[Lightburne], 2/5th, 2/58th.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></p>

<p class="hang0">Subsequent changes <span class="locked">were:—</span></p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Cavalry.</i> Payne went home before June 1, Cotton obtaining
sole command from June 3.</p>

<p>On April 1 the 13th Light Dragoons arrived at Lisbon,
joining the army in May, and being attached to Hill’s
division, along with four regiments of Portuguese cavalry,
the whole under Fane, who gave over his brigade to de Grey
from May 13. Two troops of the regiment went to Cadiz,
but rejoined the regiment in September.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
Before the end of the year Fane seems to have gone
home ill.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>1st Division.</i> On April 26 Cotton was posted to the command
of the division, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice</i> Sherbrooke, gone home ill, but gave
place to Spencer, June 3, on getting the Cavalry Division.</p>

<p>In the “States” of March 8 to August 1, no brigadier
is given for I B. On August 4 Lord Blantyre (of 2/42nd)
was appointed to command I B “during the absence of
Brigadier-General Cameron.” Cameron was back in command
from October 1, but on November 26 he was invalided
home, Blantyre probably commanding again.</p>

<p>By the Orders of September 12, 1/79th (just arrived from
Cadiz), was posted to I B <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice</i> 1/61st, to be transferred to
a new brigade to form part of the 1st Division. These orders
were suspended from September 14, and at Bussaco 1/7th
(arrived from Halifax before end of July), and 1/79th formed
a brigade (I D) under Pakenham.</p>

<p>On October 6, orders were given for the transfer of
Pakenham’s brigade to the 4th Division, the exchange
between the 1/61st and 1/79th having been carried out
previously, and a new brigade was added under Erskine,
comprising 1/50th (arrived September 24), 1/71st (arrived
September 26), 1/92nd (arrived in October, before the 6th),
and 1 company 3/95th.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>2nd Division.</i> On June 20 Leith was appointed to command
“Tilson’s brigade,” and to command the division “under
Hill,” but in the “State” of July 8 his name appears as commanding
the brigade composed of 3/1st, 1/9th, and 2/38th.
On August 8 orders were issued to W. Stewart to take
command of Tilson’s brigade and of the division under Hill.
In November Hill went on sick leave.</p>

<p>Leith’s name ceases to appear in the returns as commanding
II A from July 8, and W. Stewart’s name appears
in his place from July 27. When Stewart commanded
the division, Colborne of 2/66th had the brigade. C. Craufurd
died in September, and at Bussaco Wilson of 2/39th commanded
II C. On September 30 Lumley was posted to
command it.</p>

<p>Before September 1 R. Stewart had gone home ill, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
at Bussaco Inglis (of 1/57th) commanded II B. On October
8 Hoghton was posted to it.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>3rd Division.</i> From January 8 on 5/60th no longer appear in
the Returns as belonging to the division, and their place in the
brigade was taken by 74th, who arrived at Lisbon February 8,
and are mentioned in Orders on February 22 as in III B.</p>

<p>On February 22 the division was reorganized, R.
Craufurd’s brigade becoming, with two battalions of Caçadores,
the Light Division. Mackinnon’s brigade now became
III A, and Lightburne’s brigade was transferred from the
4th Division and became III B. The headquarters
and three companies 5/60th were posted to Lightburne’s
brigade, the remaining companies having been posted to
I A, I B, II A, II B, II C, IV A, IV B. At the same
time a Portuguese brigade composed of the 9th and 21st
Regiments (under Harvey) was added to the division.</p>

<p>At Bussaco Champlemond was in command of the Portuguese
brigade, by October 29 Sutton had it, Champlemond
being wounded at Bussaco.</p>

<p>On September 12 2/83rd was posted to III B, 2/88th
having arrived from Cadiz to relieve them September 4.
Hurrying to the front they joined their brigade before Bussaco.
When they did join, 2/58th was detached from III B for
garrison duty at Lisbon. 94th (arrived from Cadiz September
20), were added to III B on October 6, and on October 10
Colville was posted to command the brigade <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice</i> Lightburne,
who went home.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>4th Division.</i> On the transfer of Lightburne’s brigade to the
3rd Division the other two brigades exchanged places,
Kemmis’ becoming IV A, and being Cole’s brigade, but
under the immediate command of Kemmis. A. Campbell,
who had rejoined, took command of his old brigade.</p>

<p>The 3rd and 15th Portuguese were added to the division
in February, as a brigade under Collins.</p>

<p>At Bussaco the Portuguese brigade consisted of the 11th
and 23rd, the 3rd and 15th having been removed to the
5th Division.</p>

<p>On October 6 A. Campbell’s brigade was removed from
the division to become the nucleus of the newly-formed
6th Division, its place being taken by Pakenham’s from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
1st Division, <i>i.e.</i> 1/7th, 1/61st, to which the Brunswick
Oels Light Infantry (arrived Lisbon September 17) were
added.</p>

<p>On November 12 the Brunswick Oels were removed to
the Light Division, but one company was posted to IV B,
two more being detached to provide the newly-formed 5th
Division, with extra light troops. Their place in IV B
was taken by the newly arrived 1/23rd from Halifax, Nova
Scotia.</p>

<p>On November 17 2/7th and 1/61st were ordered to
exchange, IV B thus becoming the Fusilier Brigade.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Light Division.</i> Formed on February 22 by the removal of
R. Craufurd’s brigade from the 3rd Division, the 1st and
3rd Portuguese Caçadores being added to it. On August 4
it was broken up into two brigades, as follows: A [Beckwith
of 1/95th] 1/43rd, 4 companies 1/95th, 1st Caçadores; B
[Barclay of 1/52nd] 1/52nd, 4 companies 1/95th, 3rd Caçadores.
Barclay having been wounded at Bussaco, Wynch
of 1/4th got the brigade (in Orders of November 14th).</p>

<p>A company of 2/95th (from Cadiz) was added to A before
October 1. On November 12 nine companies Brunswick Oels
joined B.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>5th Division.</i> Officially this division first appears in the “State”
of August 8, when the 3/1st, 1/9th, and 2/38th,<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> are first
called the “Fifth Division,” a Portuguese brigade, Spry’s
(<i>i.e.</i> 3rd and 15th Line), being added, and Leith being
G.O.C.</p>

<p>On August 4 J. S. Barns of 3/1st was appointed to
command the British brigade, being superseded by Hay
September 30.</p>

<p>On October 6 orders were issued that Leith should command
the 5th Division, and that it should be composed
of Brigadier-General Hay’s brigade, a brigade made up of
1/4th (from England, they first appear in the “State” of
November 15), 2/30th (from Cadiz), and 2/44th (from Cadiz),
and Spry’s Portuguese.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
On November 5 Dunlop was posted to V B, hitherto
under its senior battalion commander.</p>

<p>On November 12 a company of the Brunswick Oels was
posted to each of the British brigades.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>6th Division.</i> Ordered to be formed October 6, by taking A.
Campbell’s brigade out of the 4th Division and adding
Eben’s Portuguese (<i>i.e.</i> 8th Line and Lusitanian Legion)
to it: A. Campbell being G.O.C.</p>

<p>On November 14, Hulse was posted to A. Campbell’s
brigade.</p>

<p>On November 17 1/61st from IV B exchanged with 2/7th.</p>

<p>In addition to the Portuguese brigades attached to the
3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Divisions there were at least five
others, two of which, the 4th under Archibald Campbell
(=4th and 10th Line), and 2nd under Fonseca (=2nd and 14th
Line) formed a division under Hamilton, which acted throughout
under Hill. Wellington says that he intended to organize
this division like the rest, but the heavy losses at Albuera
and the consequent necessity of reforming the 2nd Division
made it impossible for him to carry out his resolve. [Cf.
<cite>Wellington Dispatches</cite>, viii. 111.]</p>

<p>The remaining brigades were the 1st (Pack’s), consisting
of the 1st and 16th Line and 4th Caçadores, the 5th (A.
Campbell’s), 6th and 18th Line, and 6th Caçadores; the 6th
(Coleman’s), 7th and 19th Line and 2nd Caçadores. On
the formation of the 7th Division in March, 1811, Coleman’s
brigade was posted to it, the other two remaining unattached.</p>

<p>The 12th and 13th Line and 5th Caçadores seem to have
formed yet another brigade under Bradford, but in October
the 13th Line was in garrison at Abrantes.</p>

<p>Spry’s brigade ranked at the 3rd, Eben’s as the 7th,
Sutton’s as the 8th, and Collins’ as the 9th.</p>

<p class="hang0">Subsequent changes <span class="locked">were:—</span></p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Cavalry.</i> Cotton went home January 15, returning April 22;
in his absence Slade commanded the division until March
7, when Erskine seems to have been placed in command
of both the Cavalry and the Light Division. While Slade
had the division, his brigade was apparently under Hawker
of 14th Light Dragoons, and from March 1 to May 15, G. Anson<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
being absent, Arentschildt of 1st K.G.L. Hussars, commanded
C.</p>

<p>On March 19 Long was posted to command the cavalry
of the force usually under Hill, but commanded by Beresford
during Hill’s absence. At Albuera Lumley (of II C) was
in command of Beresford’s cavalry, Long’s conduct not
having given satisfaction to the Marshal. On May 11 Erskine
was appointed to command “the cavalry south of the Tagus.”</p>

<p>On June 13 a new brigade, D, was formed under Long,
composed of 13th Light Dragoons and 2nd Hussars K.G.L.,
two squadrons of which had landed April 8. On June 18
the 11th Light Dragoons (arrived June 1) replaced the 13th,
transferred to Slade’s brigade.</p>

<p>On June 19 a reorganization of the cavalry in two divisions
was ordered, as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p class="hang6">1st Cavalry Division. G.O.C., Cotton. B [Slade], 1st
Dragoons, 13th and 14th Light Dragoons; C [G. Anson],
16th Light Dragoons, 1st Hussars, K.G.L.; also
Madden’s Portuguese.</p>

<p class="hang6">2nd Cavalry Division. G.O.C., Erskine. A [de Grey],
3rd Dragoon Guards, 4th Dragoons; D [Long],
11th Light Dragoons, 2nd Hussars, K.G.L.</p>

<p>On July 19 another reorganization took place, the
final result being as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<p class="hang6">1st Cavalry Division. G.O.C., Cotton. B [Slade], 1st
Dragoons, 12th Light Dragoons (arrived July 1),
vice 13th (to C) and 14th (to D); C [G. Anson],
13th and 16th Light Dragoons; E [V. Alten, a new
brigade], 11th Light Dragoons (from D) and 1st
Hussars, K.G.L. (from C); Madden’s Portuguese.</p>

<p class="hang6">2nd Cavalry Division. A [de Grey], 3rd Dragoon Guards,
4th Dragoons; D [Long], 14th Light Dragoons, 2nd
Hussars, K.G.L.</p>

<p>On August 1, 9th Light Dragoons (newly arrived) were
posted to Long’s brigade, together with 13th Light Dragoons,
which exchanged from C with 14th.</p>

<p>On August 30, a new brigade, F, was added, comprising
4th Dragoon Guards, arrived August 15, and 3rd Dragoons,
arrived before August 20, its commander being Le Marchant.
By October 1, 5th Dragoon Guards had been added to this
brigade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
On October 5 de Grey’s brigade was transferred to the 1st
Cavalry Division, to which Le Marchant’s was attached by
Orders of November 8, the Portuguese brigade being struck
off that division.</p>

<p>From December 8 on the States do not give any G.O.C.
for the 2nd Cavalry Division.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>1st Division.</i> On January 23 Nightingale was posted to I B:
on February 6 Howard obtained I D, when Erskine was
transferred to the command of the 5th Division. On June 8
H. Campbell’s name is given in the “State” as in command
of I A, Stopford being transferred to IV B (in Orders for
this June 18). Nightingale departing to Bengal before
June 25 his brigade had no permanent commander till
July 28, when Stopford got it.</p>

<p>Owing to the heavy losses of the 2nd Division at Albuera
and its consequent reconstruction, Howard’s brigade was
transferred to it on June 6, and at the same time the detachment
of the Light Battalions of the K.G.L., hitherto in I C,
rejoined those battalions, which had been posted to VII A.</p>

<p>On June 26 orders were issued for the 7th Line K.G.L.,
to go home, its rank and file being drafted into the other
three battalions. On July 21 1/26th were added to I B,
having recently arrived from England.</p>

<p>On August 9, Graham was appointed to command the
division, Spencer having gone home in July, he received
leave July 25. From December 1 onward I B appears in
the “States” as having no G.O.C.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>2nd Division.</i> The heavy losses at Albuera led to the reorganization
of the division, detailed in Orders June 6.
Howard’s brigade of the 1st Division was transferred to the
2nd Division, becoming II A. The remainder of the
brigades of Colborne and Hoghton (who was killed) were
formed into a Provisional Battalion, less 1/48th and 2/48th;
1/48th, to which the rank and file of 2/48th were drafted
(the cadre of 2/48th going home), was transferred to IV B.</p>

<p>This Provisional Battalion was placed in Lumley’s
brigade, of which Abercromby (of 2/28th) had had temporary
command at Albuera, while Lumley was in charge of the
cavalry. At the same time, Ashworth’s Portuguese brigade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
was definitely attached to it: this was the 5th Brigade,
which had been under A. Campbell in October, 1810, but
had come under Ashworth by March 11; it comprised the
6th and 18th Line and 6th Caçadores. Cf. also <cite>Wellington
Dispatches</cite>, viii, 566, and S. D. vii. 135.</p>

<p>Before the end of May Hill returned and took over
command of the division, as well as of the whole force commanded
by Beresford at Albuera.</p>

<p>On July 22 1/28th (newly arrived from Gibraltar) was
posted to Lumley’s brigade.</p>

<p>On August 7 orders were issued for 1/3rd and 1/57th to
resume their separate formations, large drafts having arrived
from their second battalions in England. The division was
again formed in three brigades, Howard’s being II A, and
1/3rd, 1/57th, and the Provisional Battalion, [<i>i.e.</i> 29th
(3 companies), 2/31st (4 companies) and 2/66th (3 companies)]
forming II B, apparently under Inglis of 1/57th, while 1/28th,
2/28th, 2/34th, and 2/39th under Lumley formed II C.</p>

<p>On August 21 2/28th was drafted into 1/28th, and sent
home, and the company 3/95th, hitherto in Howard’s brigade,
were transferred to Beckwith’s brigade of the Light Division,
being replaced in II A by a company of 5/60th, there being
three with the division.</p>

<p>On September 21 Byng was posted to command II B,
and on October 9 Wilson was appointed to command II C,
Lumley having gone home sick early in August.</p>

<p>On October 3 orders were issued for 29th to go home to
recruit; on October 20 1/39th, just arrived from Sicily,
was added to II C, 2/39th being drafted into it and sent home
by Orders issued December 17.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>3rd Division.</i> Orders of March 5 direct the transfer of the
headquarter companies 5/60th to III A, 2/88th, on garrison
duty at Lisbon since September 4, 1810, being added to III B.
On July 10, 2/88th was ordered to be drafted into 1/88th, and
the cadre sent home.</p>

<p>On July 22 the 77th were added to III B.</p>

<p>From July 1 to October 31 Mackinnon was absent from
his brigade, ill, Wallace of 1/88th commanding it in his
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
On December 22 Colville was transferred to the command
of the 4th Division, in Cole’s absence on leave, J. Campbell
of the 94th getting III B.</p>

<p>Champlemond had the Portuguese brigade on March 19;
but by Fuentes Power had it.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>4th Division.</i> By February 1 the headquarters and 9 companies
Brunswick Oels had been added to IV A, having been
removed from the Light Division, but on the formation
of the 7th Division (March 5), they were removed
to it.</p>

<p>On January 23 Houston was appointed to IV B <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice</i>
Pakenham, but left the brigade again March 5, on being
appointed to command the 7th Division: Myers would
seem to have commanded IV B till Albuera, where he was
killed. On June 18 Stopford was appointed to command
IV B, but was transferred to I B on July 28, Pakenham
again getting IV B. From November 15 onwards the
“States” do not give any brigadier for IV B, but it continued
to be described as “Pakenham’s.”</p>

<p>After Albuera 2/7th was drafted into 1/7th, the remnants
being sent home June 26; 1/48th from the 2nd Division
was added to IV B June 6. On October 3, the 97th, a single
battalion regiment, was ordered home in consequence of its
severe losses.</p>

<p>On December 22 Colville was appointed to command
the division, Cole having gone home ill.</p>

<p>At Albuera Harvey was in command of the Portuguese
brigade of the division, to which 1st battalion Loyal Lusitanian
Legion had been added on March 14: by September
this unit was renamed 7th Caçadores, the brigade was then
again under Collins, who at Albuera had led a provisional
brigade from the Elvas garrison [5th Line, 5th Caçadores].</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>5th Division.</i> From February 1 to February 6 the division was
without a G.O.C., Leith being absent: on February 6,
Erskine was appointed to command it, but was transferred
to the command of the advanced guard (the Light Division<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
and cavalry), from March 7 to April 22. During this period
Dunlop seems to have commanded the division, Egerton
of 2/44th commanding V B.</p>

<p>On May 11 Erskine was appointed to the 2nd Cavalry
Division, and Dunlop again had temporary command of
the division until October 2, when G. T. Walker was appointed
to command his brigade. By December 1 Leith was again
in command of the division.</p>

<p>On March 14 the 2nd Battalion Loyal Lusitanian Legion
had been added to Spry’s Portuguese brigade. By September
it had been renamed 8th Caçadores.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>6th Division.</i> Orders of March 5 directed the addition to the
division of a new brigade under Burne (of 1/36th), comprising
2nd and 1/36th.</p>

<p>It seems to have been intended to put the Brunswick
Oels into the 6th Division, but on the formation of the
7th Division (March 5), they were put in C. Alten’s brigade.</p>

<p>On July 21 1/32nd, arrived at Lisbon before July 8, was
posted to VI B.</p>

<p>A. Campbell leaving for India in November, the division
was without a definite G.O.C. till the end of the year, Burne
commanding it temporarily.</p>

<p>On March 14 the Loyal Lusitanian Legion was removed
from the Portuguese brigade of the division, and distributed
as Caçador battalions to the 4th and 5th Divisions, being
replaced by the 12th Line, formerly in Bradford’s brigade.
At Fuentes Madden commanded the brigade.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Light Division.</i> Wynch dying January 6, the 2nd Brigade was
without a commander till February 7, when Drummond (of
1/52nd) was appointed to it. Craufurd having gone home
on leave before February 8, the division had no G.O.C.,
but was under Erskine from March 7 on, together with the
Cavalry who also were in the advanced guard.</p>

<p>On March 5 2/52nd, newly arrived at Lisbon, was added
to Drummond’s brigade.</p>

<p>R. Craufurd returned April 22 and took over the division
from Erskine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
By August 1 Beckwith had been invalided home, Andrew
Barnard of the 95th commanding the brigade in his place.</p>

<p>On August 21 the headquarters and four companies of
the 3/95th, which had gone out to Cadiz in 1810, arrived
at Lisbon, and were added to the 1st Brigade, the company
3/95th hitherto with II A being also added to the same
brigade.</p>

<p>Drummond dying before September 8, Vandeleur was
appointed to the vacant brigade on September 30. By
October 1 another company 2/95th had been added to the
1st Brigade.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>7th Division.</i> Orders were issued on March 5 for the formation
of this division, to be composed of two British brigades
under C. Alten and Long, and Coleman’s Portuguese, <i>i.e.</i>
7th and 19th Line and 2nd Caçadores. The composition of the
British brigades is not given, but General Orders say that the
Brunswick Oels should be in Alten’s brigade, and the Chasseurs
Britanniques (arrived at Lisbon from Cadiz, January 28)
in Long’s. The other regiments in the division were 51st
(arrived during February), 85th (arrived March 4), which
were in Long’s brigade, and the 1st and 2nd Light Battalions,
K.G.L., in Alten’s. These last only landed on March 21,
and did not join the division till it came down with Wellington
from Almeida to the Guadiana Valley for the second
siege of Badajoz. Till then they had been attached to the
force under Beresford: Schwertfeger (<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Geschichte der K.G.L.</i>,
i. 317) says the battalions formed part of the 2nd Division, but
this does not seem accurate. As they had no casualties at
the siege of Badajoz, in which the 7th Division suffered severely,
one may presume that they finally joined the division after
the siege was raised.</p>

<p>Thus the British brigade (at first there was only one) was
51st, 85th, Chasseurs Britanniques, Brunswick Oels. On
March 31 Sontag was posted to it <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice</i> Long, removed to
command Beresford’s cavalry, March 19.</p>

<p>On July 19 68th (just arrived) was posted to VII B.</p>

<p>Houston was invalided home before August 1, Sontag
commanding the division. By October he too was invalided
(his A.D.C. received orders to rejoin his regiment on October<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
29). Alten was in temporary command, C. Halkett commanding
his brigade. VII B was without a G.O.C. from
October 15 till de Bernewitz got it on December 23.</p>

<p>On October 3 85th (a single-battalion regiment) was
ordered to go home to recruit.</p>

<p>Le Cor was posted to Coleman’s brigade on March 14; at
Fuentes Doyle had it.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Portuguese.</i> No changes seem to have taken place in Hamilton’s
division, or in Pack’s brigade, but the other unattached
brigade was under McMahon in September, and included the
13th and 22nd Line and 5th Caçadores, the 12th Line having
been transferred to the 6th Division.</p>

1/95th, 3rd Caçadores.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Portuguese.</i> Hamilton’s division, with brigades under Fonseca
and Arch. Campbell. Unattached brigades under Pack and
McMahon.</p>

<p class="hang0">Subsequent changes <span class="locked">were:—</span></p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Cavalry.</i> On January 1 the 1st and 2nd Dragoons, K.G.L., under
Bock arrived at Lisbon: they remained near there till
March 12, joining the army at Estremoz March 23, and
being reckoned as the 2nd Brigade (= G) of the 2nd Cavalry
Division.</p>

<p>By January 8 V. Alten was again in command of his
brigade.</p>

<p>Several changes took place under orders issued January
29; the 3rd and 4th Dragoon Guards were posted to Slade’s
brigade, from which the 12th Light Dragoons were removed
to G. Anson’s, the 4th Dragoons replaced the 4th Dragoon
Guards in Le Marchant’s, and de Grey’s brigade disappeared.
F. Ponsonby of the 12th Light Dragoons took command of
C in Anson’s absence.</p>

<p>By April 8 Erskine had resumed command of the 2nd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
Cavalry Division, to which Slade’s brigade was transferred
April 14, Bock’s joining the 1st Division.</p>

<p>On July 1, an exchange was ordered between the 11th
and 14th Light Dragoons: G. Anson, who had resumed
command of his brigade, having 11th, 12th and 16th Light
Dragoons, V. Alten 14th Light Dragoons and 1st Hussars,
K.G.L.</p>

<p>At Salamanca Cotton was wounded, and Le Marchant
killed. While Cotton was disabled, Bock commanded the
Cavalry, de Jonquières having his brigade. W. Ponsonby,
of 5th Dragoon Guards, succeeded to Le Marchant’s brigade
(by orders of July 23). Cotton rejoined before October 15,
but had to go home again in December invalided. From
August 1 V. Alten was absent, but rejoined by the middle
of September.</p>

<p>By Orders of October 17, 2nd Hussars, K.G.L., were
transferred to V. Alten’s brigade.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>1st Division.</i> Stopford resumed command of I B before
February 1, but was gone again by April 8. On May 7
Wheatley was appointed to command the brigade until
Stopford’s return.</p>

<p>1/26th, being too sickly for field service, was out of I B
before March 8, being sent down to Lisbon, and thence to
Gibraltar to relieve 1/82nd. Their place in I B was taken
by 1/42nd, just arrived from England and posted to I B
April 23. On May 19 2/42nd was ordered home, drafting
its rank and file into 1/42nd. 2/58th was posted to I B
by Orders of April 2; on June 1 its transfer to V B
was ordered, but “orders will hereafter be given as to the
regiment joining the brigade.” It seems to have remained
with I B till after the retreat from Burgos.</p>

<p>Graham going home ill July 6, H. Campbell was appointed
to command the division, Fermor getting I A.</p>

<p>Wheatley died September 1, Stirling (of 1/42nd) being
appointed to I B September 11.</p>

<p>On October 11 E. Paget was posted to command the
division, but he was taken prisoner November 17, his place
being taken by W. Stewart, who had just returned to the
Peninsula.</p>

<p>After the retreat from Burgos the division was reorganized.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
A new brigade of Guards was added, composed of 1/1st
(Grenadier) Guards, who arrived at Corunna from England
October 1 and joined the army on the Carrion October 24, and
3/1st Guards, who had been at Cadiz, and came up to Madrid
with Skerrett’s column. This was ordered October 17,
but cannot have been carried out till later. On November
10 Howard was transferred from II A to command this
brigade. On November 11 Stirling’s brigade was ordered
to be removed to the 6th Division, the company of 5/60th
attached to it remaining in the 1st Division. On December
6 the 1st and 2nd Light Battalions, K.G.L., were removed
from VII A to the K.G.L. brigade of the 1st Division.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>2nd Division.</i> In Orders of April 14, Tilson-Chowne (formerly
Tilson) was appointed to command the division, “under
Hill,” but though present at Almaraz in May does not seem
to have been present to the end of the year. Howard being
transferred to the 1st Division, November 10, Cadogan
(of 1/71st) took command of II A.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>3rd Division.</i> At Ciudad Rodrigo Mackinnon was killed (January
19), his brigade going to Kempt—in Orders February 8.</p>

<p>At Badajoz Picton and Kempt were wounded (April 6),
Wallace taking over Kempt’s brigade, and also having
temporary command of the division when Picton was disabled:
Forbes (of 1/45th) then commanded III A.</p>

<p>After the fall of Badajoz 77th (a single battalion regiment)
was sent down to Lisbon, being much reduced.</p>

<p>On June 28 Pakenham was appointed to command
“Colville’s brigade in the 3rd Division,” <i>i.e.</i> III B. At
Salamanca he commanded the division, Picton having gone
sick again, Wallace and J. Campbell having the brigades.</p>

<p>1/5th, which arrived in May, was posted to III B June 1,
both battalions were at Salamanca, but on July 27 2/5th
was drafted into 1/5th, the skeleton going home in October.</p>

<p>By Orders of October 17 2/87th, which had come up
from Cadiz with Skerrett, was posted to III B, then still
called “Colville’s.”</p>

<p>Wallace was invalided home after the retreat from Burgos.</p>

<p>Pakenham was to retain command of the division till
the return of “Colville or some other” (<i>W. D.</i>, v. 399), his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
name does not appear in the States as commanding III B
after November 1: Colville apparently came back before the
end of the year: <i>D. N. B.</i> says in October.</p>

<p>On April 8 Power took over the Portuguese brigade,
Champlemond, who had it <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice</i> Palmeirim by March 17, having
been wounded at Badajoz: 12th Caçadores were added to it
on April 8.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>4th Division.</i> On February 9, Bowes was appointed to command
“the brigade late under Pakenham,” <i>i.e.</i> IV B. In April
Colville was wounded at Badajoz, and the division was
without a G.O.C. till Cole returned—before July 8.</p>

<p>At Salamanca (July 22), Cole was wounded, and was
absent in consequence till October 15. In Cole’s absence
W. Anson, who was appointed to IV A April 9, would
have commanded the division. The vacancy in IV A
was caused by the departure of Kemmis—before April 1:
at Badajoz Harcourt (of 1/40th) commanded IV A.</p>

<p>Bowes was transferred to the 6th Division May 2, and
it would appear that Ellis (of 1/23rd) commanded IV B
temporarily. He certainly was in charge of it at Salamanca,
and apparently kept it till Skerrett took charge of it. It
was then still described as “Pakenham’s,” as was also the
case as late as November 28. Skerrett was appointed to it
on October 17, but his force from Cadiz only joined Hill
on October 26, and the arrangements ordered on October 17
can hardly have been carried out at once.</p>

<p>Skerrett’s brigade (3/1st Guards, 2/47th, 2/87th and 2
companies 2/95th) seems to have acted with IV after joining
Hill’s force, but was broken up when operations ceased.</p>

<p>Orders of October 17 directed 1/82nd, which had come
up from Gibraltar in June and was with the 4th Division at
Madrid, to join IV B, but the battalion was transferred to
VII A by Orders of November 28, the 20th which arrived
in December being posted to IV B instead. On 1/82nd
joining, 1/48th was transferred to IV A.</p>

<p>On December 6 the 2nd Provisional Battalion (<i>i.e.</i> 2nd
and 1/53rd) was posted to IV A.</p>

<p>By Salamanca Stubbs had taken over command of the
Portuguese Brigade, which had been under Harvey by
March 17 and at the siege of Badajoz.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span></p>

<p class="hang2"><i>5th Division.</i> At Badajoz Walker was wounded (April 6):
his brigade had no regular G.O.C. till Pringle was appointed
to it June 28.</p>

<p>On May 10 2/4th, arrived at Lisbon during April, was
posted to V B. In June 1/38th came out and was present
at Salamanca, apparently with V A, but it only appears as
part of that brigade in the “States” of August 8 and
afterwards.</p>

<p>Orders of June 1 directed 2/58th to join V B, but the
battalion seems to have been with I B till reorganized as
part of the 3rd Provisional Battalion in December.</p>

<p>Hay was absent from June 8, Greville of 1/38th commanding
the brigade till July 31, when Hulse was transferred
to it. Hulse must have also commanded the division,
as Leith was wounded at Salamanca and invalided home.
Hulse dying (September 6), Pringle commanded the division,
until Oswald was appointed to it (October 25), when Pringle
reverted to his brigade, of which Brooke (of 4th) had been
in command.</p>

<p>Orders of June 18 directed 1/9th to exchange with 2/30th
and 2/44th, but these were cancelled June 28. E. Barnes
was in Orders to command V A October 28, but seems to
have been with the brigade at Villa Muriel three days earlier.
On December 6 he was transferred to VII A. Hay
appears to have returned before December 31.</p>

<p>On December 6 Orders directed the drafting 2/4th into
1/4th and 2/38th into 1/38th, the skeletons being sent home,
also for forming 2/30th and 2/44th into a Provisional Battalion,
the 4th. By Orders of October 17 2/47th of Skerrett’s
column had been posted to V B, which was then described
as Walker’s brigade.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>6th Division.</i> On February 9 H. Clinton was appointed to
command the division.</p>

<p>By April 1 VI B was without a brigadier: Bowes was
appointed to it May 2, but he was killed in the attack on
the Salamanca forts (June 24). On this Hinde, of 32nd,
commanded the brigade, being appointed definitely to it
September 30, but ante-dated to June.</p>

<p>On Hulse being transferred to V A, July 31, VI A was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
without a brigadier, Bingham, of 2/53rd, being actually
in command, until the amalgamation of the two brigades
by Orders of November 11. At the same time Stirling’s
brigade was transferred from the 1st Division to the 6th,
1/91st, which arrived at Corunna October 8, being added
to it by Orders of November 28—it actually joined
December 14.</p>

<p>On December 6 orders were issued for the formation of
2nd and 2/53rd as the 2nd Provisional Battalion, and of 2/24th,
and 2/58th as the 3rd Provisional Battalion, and for their
transfer to IV A and VII A respectively.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Brigade was under Eben till April 30, when
the Conde de Rezende took command. It was joined by 9th
Caçadores on April 10. Rezende was invalided in November,
and succeeded by Madden.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>7th Division.</i> On May 2 Alten was transferred to command the
Light Division: John Hope being given command of the
7th. Halkett of 2nd Light Battalion, K.G.L. seems to
have commanded VII A, though in the “States” no brigadier
is named from May 2 till December 6, when E. Barnes was
appointed to it.</p>

<p>Hope having to quit the army on account of his health
September 23, the division had no G.O.C. till October 25,
when Lord Dalhousie was appointed to it, having been
put on the Staff of the Army September 12.</p>

<p>On November 28, 1/6th, newly arrived from England, was
added to VII A, then called “Colonel Halkett’s,” and 1/82nd,
from IV B, was added to VII B.</p>

<p>Orders of December 6 directed the transfer of the Light
Battalions, K.G.L., to the 1st Division, the 3rd Provisional
Battalion (<i>i.e.</i> 2/24th and 2/58th) being added to VII A.</p>

<p>The Portuguese Brigade was under Palmeirim in March:
later it seems to have been under Doyle of the 19th Line.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Light Division.</i> At Ciudad Rodrigo (January 19), Craufurd was
killed, and Vandeleur wounded; Barnard then took command
of the division, and Gibbs of 1/52nd of the 2nd Brigade.
By April 15 Vandeleur had resumed command, 2/52nd was
drafted to 1/52nd by Orders of February 23, the skeleton
being sent home.</p>

<p>On May 2 C. Alten received command of the division.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
By May 8 1/95th had been united in the 2nd Brigade,
but Orders of August 24 again divided it, 3 companies in
each brigade: before the end of the year it was again
united and placed in the 1st Brigade.</p>

<p>Two more companies 2/95th came out from England in
May, and joined those already out, the four being in the
2nd Brigade. Two more came up from Cadiz with Skerrett,
and joined the brigade.</p>

<p>3/95th seems to have been transferred temporarily to the
2nd Brigade, but was back in the 1st by the end of the year.</p>

<p>The 20th Portuguese, which had come up with Skerrett,
were posted to “Beckwith’s brigade,” October 17.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Portuguese.</i> In April, 1812, Power had replaced Arch. Campbell
in command of the 4th Brigade, while Bradford had the
11th <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice</i> McMahon: this now included the 5th Caçadores,
13th and 24th Line.</p>

<p>By July Power had exchanged the 4th Brigade for the
8th, which was in the 3rd Division. A. Campbell would
seem to have again commanded the 4th, to which on April 8
the 10th Caçadores were added.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Portuguese.</i> Hamilton’s division, brigades under (?) Fonseca
and Campbell. Unattached brigades, Pack’s and Bradford’s.</p>

<p class="hang0">Subsequent changes <span class="locked">were:—</span></p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Cavalry.</i> By January 25 a new brigade (H) was added,
composed of two squadrons each of 1st and 2nd Life Guards
and Royal Horse Guards, O’Loghlin had apparently been
appointed to command it, but by Orders of November 28,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
1812, F. S. Rebow was appointed to command it in his
place. It ranked as 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, but was
transferred to the 1st on February 5. In March it was
under Sir Robert Hill, Rebow having gone home.</p>

<p>Orders of March 13 directed the distribution among the
regiments remaining in the Peninsula of the horses of 4th
Dragoon Guards, 9th and 11th Light Dragoons, and 2nd
K.G.L. Hussars, these regiments going home. Their place
was taken by a new brigade (I), under Colquhoun
Grant, of 15th Hussars, composed of the 10th, 15th
and 18th Hussars: this first appears in the “States” on
April 15.</p>

<p>Orders were issued April 21 for the amalgamation of the
two divisions, “under the command of Sir S. Cotton”:
Cotton did not, however, rejoin till June 25, and in his
absence Bock seems to have commanded the cavalry, his
brigade being under Bülow.</p>

<p>On May 20 Fane, appointed a Major-General on the Staff
April 24, was given B vice Slade, who had been ordered
home April 23.</p>

<p>On July 2 orders were issued to transfer the 18th Hussars
to V. Alten’s brigade, vice the 14th Light Dragoons moved
to Long’s, which had been reduced to one regiment by the
departure of the 9th Light Dragoons (out of the “States” by
April 4). Lord E. Somerset at the same time was given
command of the Hussar brigade <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice</i> Grant and Vandeleur,
that of C <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice</i> G. Anson, removed to the Home
Staff.</p>

<p>On September 6 Grant was appointed to take over
Long’s brigade, Long having apparently gone home before
the battles of the Pyrenees, as his name was not among the
commanders of Cavalry brigades thanked by Parliament
on November 8 for those operations. On November 24
Hussey Vivian was appointed to take Grant’s place.</p>

<p>7th Hussars arrived in Spain in September, and were
added to the Hussar brigade. They would seem to have
been with the brigade by October 21, but were not in Orders
till November 24.</p>

<p>In October O’Loghlin seems to have taken over the
Household Brigade, he had been placed on the Staff June 17.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>

<p class="hang2"><i>1st Division.</i> In March Howard replaced W. Stewart in command,
but on May 19 Graham was appointed to command
the division Howard acting as his assistant while Graham
commanded the left wing of the army. On October 8
Graham resigned command and went home ill. Sir John
Hope<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> took his place: he was placed on the Staff October
10, as from September 25.</p>

<p>While Howard commanded the division his brigade was
under Lambert; it missed Vittoria, being too sickly to take
the field with the army and only joined in August.</p>

<p>On July 2 Lambert was transferred to VI B, and Maitland
got the brigade.</p>

<p>Löw went home May 6, the K.G.L. being certainly
one brigade only at Vittoria, where Halkett commanded
them.</p>

<p>Lord Aylmer’s brigade (76th, 2/84th and 85th) which is
first mentioned in Orders on July 23, and joined the
army during August, may be reckoned as part of the 1st
Division with which it always acted. By Orders of October
17 2/62nd was added to it vice 2/84th transferred to V B.
On November 24 the 77th (from Lisbon) was added to it.</p>

<p>On October 20 Hinüber was appointed to command the
K.G.L. infantry.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>2nd Division.</i> On March 25 W. Stewart was appointed to
command the division “under Hill’s direction.” At the
same time G. T. Walker got Howard’s brigade, on the latter
taking over the 1st Division from Stewart.</p>

<p>Wilson died in January and O’Callaghan of 39th commanded
the brigade till July 23, when Pringle was appointed
to it. On May 1 Wellington had written that he was keeping
it vacant for Oswald, should Leith come out and take over
the 5th Division.</p>

<p>At Vittoria Cadogan was killed and J. Cameron of 92nd
took over II A; he was wounded at Maya (July 25), and
Fitzgerald of 5/60th commanded, till Walker actually joined
in August. On November 18 Walker was transferred to
command the 7th Division, Barnes being appointed to II A
November 20.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>

<p class="hang2"><i>3rd Division.</i> Pakenham was transferred to the 6th Division
January 26, the division being under Colville who had
returned before that date. Picton rejoined in May, Colville
reverting to the command of his brigade. Picton was again
absent from September 8, but returned just before the end
of the year. Colville was in command at the Nivelle
(November), but was transferred to command the 5th
Division, when Picton came back in December.</p>

<p>The 11th Caçadores were posted to Power’s brigade before
April 26, taking the place of the 12th.</p>

<p>Brisbane, appointed to Staff of Army January 7, was
given command of III A, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice</i> Kempt, March 25.</p>

<p>Colville being given temporary command of the 6th
Division on August 8, Keane commanded III B, as also
when Colville came back to the division.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>4th Division.</i> By Orders of July 2 Skerrett was transferred
to the Light Division, his brigade going to Ross of 20th.</p>

<p>By September 1 the Portuguese brigade was under
Miller: at the Nivelle (November 10) Vasconcellos had it.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>5th Division.</i> While Hay commanded the division Greville of
38th had his brigade. In April Oswald took over the
division and commanded it till Leith returned—August 30.
Leith was wounded at San Sebastian on September 1, and
Oswald again took command; but at the Bidassoa, (October 9)
Hay was in command, Greville having V A. On March 9
Robinson was appointed to “Walker’s brigade,” <i>i.e.</i> V B.</p>

<p>On April 12 2/59th from Cadiz was added to V B; on
May 10 the 4th Provisional Battalion was ordered to return
home. On October 17 2/84th from Lord Aylmer’s brigade
was added to V B, 2/47th being transferred to V A.
Robinson was wounded before Bayonne December 10, and his
successor, Piper of 4th, being wounded next day the command
passed to Tonson of 2/84th.</p>

<p>At the passage of the Bidassoa the Portuguese brigade
was commanded by de Regoa and until the end of the year.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>6th Division.</i> On January 26 Pakenham was appointed to
command the division in Clinton’s absence. On June 25
he was appointed Adjutant-General, and Clinton returned
and resumed command. By July 22 Clinton was again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
absent, Pack getting the division. At Sorauren (July 28)
Pack was wounded, and Pakenham took over the division
temporarily, giving it over to Colville before August 8,
Colville seems to have still been in command at the passage
of the Bidassoa (October 9), but Clinton then returned,
Colville reverting to the 3rd Division.</p>

<p>Pack had been appointed to command VI A, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice</i>
Stirling, July 2, Lambert at the same time getting VI B, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">vice</i>
Hinde. Stirling commanded VI A when Pack got the
division, but went home in October.</p>

<p>The Portuguese brigade was under the command of
Madden till the autumn: Douglas of the 8th Line had it at
the Nivelle.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>7th Division.</i> By April 16 de Bernewitz was no longer in
command of his brigade, to which Inglis was appointed
May 21, though at Vittoria Grant of 1/82nd commanded
it, but Inglis took charge before the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>Le Cor received command of the Portuguese brigade on
March 9. When he was promoted in November Doyle had it.</p>

<p>Dalhousie went home after the Bidassoa, October 9,
and at the Nivelle (November 9) Le Cor was in command.
On November 18 G. T. Walker was given command “in
Dalhousie’s absence.” Le Cor would seem to have been
transferred to command the Portuguese division formerly
under Hamilton.</p>

<p>On Barnes returning to the 2nd Division November 20,
his brigade seems to have gone to Gardiner.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Light Division.</i> On March 23 Kempt was appointed to A.
On July 2 Vandeleur was transferred to a cavalry brigade,
Skerrett getting B. At the passage of the Bidassoa and
to the end of the year Colborne of 52nd was in command
of B, vice Skerrett, who went home in September.</p>

<p>The 20th Portuguese never joined the division: in
place of them on April 26 the 17th Portuguese appear
in its “State.”</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Portuguese.</i> Hamilton had had to give up command of his
Portuguese division in February, owing to ill-health, upon
which it was under Silveira, the brigades being under
Da Costa and Campbell during the battles of the Pyrenees.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
By the passage of the Nivelle (November 9) Hamilton was
again in command, Buchan had Da Costa’s brigade, but
during the fighting on the Nive (December 9–11), Le Cor
had the division and Buchan and Da Costa the brigades.
Buchan was ordered to transfer himself to the Portuguese
Brigade of the 7th Division on Nov. 9, but this move was
countermanded.</p>

<p>When Pack was moved to a British command (July 2) his
brigade went to Wilson, who commanded it at the Bidassoa,
but had been replaced by A. Campbell by the Nive (December
9), Wilson having been wounded November 18.</p>

<p>Bradford seems to have retained the other unattached
brigade all the year.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Portuguese.</i> Le Cor’s division, with Da Costa and Buchan
commanding brigades. Unattached brigades under A.
Campbell and Bradford.</p>

<p class="hang0">Subsequent changes <span class="locked">were:—</span></p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Cavalry.</i> By January 16 several changes had taken place:
V. Alten had gone and Vivian had been transferred to his
brigade, Fane having transferred from B to D (late Vivian’s).
Bock also went (he was drowned off the coast of Brittany in
February) about the same time.</p>

<p>From January 25 W. Ponsonby was absent, Lord C.
Manners of 3rd Dragoons commanding his brigade.</p>

<p>By March 25 Arentschildt (of 1st K.G.L. Hussars) had
been given Bock’s old brigade: on Vivian being wounded
(April 8) Arentschildt was transferred to E, and Bülow got
the “German Heavy Brigade.”</p>

<p>Fane’s name appears in the “States” both as commanding
B and D. According to the <cite>Regimental History of the
14th Hussars</cite> (by Col. H. B. Hamilton) he commanded both,
working them practically as a division, the brigades being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
respectively commanded by Clifton of the Royals (B), and
Doherty of the 13th Light Dragoons (D).</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>1st Division.</i> 1/37th joined Aylmer’s brigade before March 25.
On April 14 Stopford was wounded at Bayonne and his
division went to Guise.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>2nd Division.</i> On February 15 Pringle was wounded and
O’Callaghan commanded the brigade.</p>

<p>It was arranged that when Lord Dalhousie rejoined, and
resumed command of the 7th Division, Walker should revert
to II A and Barnes take over III B, but Walker was wounded
at Orthez and went home, so the arrangement was never
carried out.</p>

<p>By January 16 Harding had replaced Ashworth in command
of the 5th Portuguese brigade.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>3rd Division.</i> No changes: Brisbane was slightly wounded at
Toulouse.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>4th Division.</i> Ross was wounded at Orthez (February 27) and
the brigade was without a G.O.C.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>5th Division.</i> After February 1 Robinson was absent.
Hay was killed before Bayonne April 14.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>6th Division.</i> Pack was wounded at Toulouse, as was also
Douglas.</p>

<p>1/32nd missed Toulouse, being at San Jean de Luz refitting.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>7th Division.</i> Walker was wounded at Orthez and went home:
Dalhousie arriving almost immediately after the battle
and resuming command.</p>

<p>By January 16, the Portuguese brigade was under Doyle
(he may have got it when Le Cor obtained command of the
Portuguese division.)</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Light Division.</i> 1/43rd and 1/95th both missed Orthez, being
away refitting.</p>

<p class="hang2"><i>Portuguese.</i> Da Costa was ordered back to Portugal before
March 15.</p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">PENINSULAR AUTOBIOGRAPHIES, JOURNALS,
LETTERS, ETC.</span></h2>

<p>The subjoined list, which includes all the printed autobiographies,
diaries, journals, and series of letters utilized in this volume, makes
no pretensions to be exhaustive. It contains, however, all the
more important original sources of this character, as opposed to
formal histories, controversial monographs, and biographies of
Peninsular officers written by authors who were not themselves
engaged in the war. But I have added to the list those later
biographies which contain a great proportion of original and contemporary
letters or diaries, such as Delavoye’s <cite>Life of Lord Lynedoch</cite>,
Rait’s <cite>Life of Lord Gough</cite>, Wrottesley’s <cite>Life of Sir John Burgoyne</cite>,
and C. Vivian’s <cite>Life of Lord Vivian</cite>. Much valuable first-hand
information is imbedded in such works.</p>

<p>The books are arranged under headings according to the position
which the writer held in the Peninsular War, mainly by regiments,
but partly under departmental sections [staff, commissariat, medical,
etc.]. I trust that the list may be found useful for those wishing to
compile regimental, brigade, or divisional annals of any part of
the war.</p>

was a battalion deployed in line, and on each of the outer sides of

of Morris of the 73rd. “The militia would be drawn up in
line, and the officers for the regiments requiring volunteers would
give a glowing description of their several corps, describing the
victories they had gained, and the honours they had acquired, and
conclude by offering the bounty. If these inducements were not
effectual in getting men, coercive measures were adopted: the
militia colonel would put on heavy and long drills and field exercises,
which were so tedious and oppressive that many men would embrace
the alternative, and volunteer for the regulars” (p. 13).</p></div>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made consistent
when a predominant preference was found in this book.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced
quotation marks were corrected when the change was obvious.</p>

<p>Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained.</p>

<p>The index was not systematically checked for proper

<p>Sidenotes in this eBook contain the text of running

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
